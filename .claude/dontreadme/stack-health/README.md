# Stack Health Reports

This directory contains timestamped reports from the stack health audit system.

## Purpose

While the scheduler and operational health are well-monitored via the resilience framework, **codebase/infrastructure health** (linting, type errors, build status, migration state) was not being persistently tracked. This directory fills that gap.

## Report Structure

Reports are named with timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`

Each report includes:
- **Summary table**: Status of each check category with counts and trends
- **Frontend checks**: Type errors, lint warnings, build status
- **Backend checks**: Lint errors, type check results
- **Infrastructure**: Migration state, Docker container health
- **Trend analysis**: Comparison with previous run (improving/worsening)

## Status Levels

| Status | Exit Code | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| GREEN | 0 | All checks pass |
| YELLOW | 1 | Warnings only |
| RED | 2 | Errors present |

## Generation

Reports are generated by:
- **Manual**: `python scripts/ops/stack_audit.py`
- **Celery**: `stack_health_check` task (runs every 4 hours)

## Retention

Reports older than 30 days may be archived or deleted to manage disk space.
