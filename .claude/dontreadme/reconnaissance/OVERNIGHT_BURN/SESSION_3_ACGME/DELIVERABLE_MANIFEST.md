## SEARCH_PARTY Probe Results

### 1. PERCEPTION - Wellness Programs ✅
**Finding:** 5-Tier wellness architecture implemented
- Tier 1: Real-time fatigue (FRMS, Samn-Perelli scale)
- Tier 2: Predictive burnout (5 materials science models)
- Tier 3: Epidemiological contagion (SIR/SEIR)
- Tier 4: Seismic precursors (STA/LTA algorithm)
- Tier 5: Multi-temporal danger (Fire Weather Index)

### 2. INVESTIGATION - Fatigue Mitigation ✅
**Finding:** Multi-level intervention strategy
- Real-time interventions (duty restrictions, rest periods)
- Short-term interventions (workload reduction, counseling)
- Long-term interventions (leave, phased return)
- Program-level interventions (rotation design, culture change)

### 3. ARCANA - ACGME Requirements ✅
**Finding:** 8/8 core rules documented and implemented
- 80-hour rule (enforced)
- 1-in-7 day off (enforced)
- Shift duration limits (enforced)
- Minimum rest (⚠️ 8h vs 10h gap)
- Night float limits (enforced)
- Call frequency (template-based, not hard constraint)
- Supervision ratios (enforced)
- Moonlighting tracking (enforced)

### 4. HISTORY - Evolution ✅
**Finding:** Progressive enhancement over 5 phases
- Phase 1: Basic compliance
- Phase 2: FRMS real-time
- Phase 3: Predictive burnout
- Phase 4: Contagion modeling
- Phase 5: Early warning systems

### 5. INSIGHT - Prevention Philosophy ✅
**Finding:** System prioritizes proactive prevention
- Predict 4-12 weeks early
- Intervene before crisis
- Scientifically-grounded
- Privacy-first design
- Learning from events

### 6. RELIGION - Systemic Tracking ✅
**Finding:** Comprehensive database + constraint integration
- 8 specialized tables
- Real-time dashboard
- Weekly/monthly/annual reports
- Alert routing
- Calibration loop

### 7. NATURE - Real vs. Performative ✅
**Finding:** REAL (not performative)
- Hard constraints at scheduling layer
- Automation prevents violations
- Prediction enables prevention
- Multi-intervention (graduated response)
- Learning loop

### 8. MEDICINE - Mental Health Resources ✅
**Finding:** Robust resource ecosystem
- EAP (24/7, confidential)
- Occupational health
- Psychiatry (on-call + outpatient)
- Peer support
- Wellness programs
- Crisis hotlines

### 9. SURVIVAL - Crisis Intervention ✅
**Finding:** Escalation protocols from GREEN to BLACK
- GREEN: monitoring
- YELLOW: early intervention
- ORANGE: workload reduction + counseling
- RED: medical leave or 50% reduction
- BLACK: emergency protocols

### 10. STEALTH - Hidden Indicators ✅
**Finding:** Multiple precursor signals detected
- Fatigue trends
- Workload anomalies (SPC rules)
- Symptom progression
- Contagion spread
- Damage accumulation
- Creep damage

## Compliance Assessment

### ACGME Alignment
| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| 80-hour rule | Hard constraint | ✅ ENFORCED |
| 1-in-7 | Hard constraint | ✅ ENFORCED |
| Supervision ratios | Fractional tracking | ✅ ENFORCED |
| Shift limits | Hard constraint | ✅ ENFORCED |
| Night float | Hard constraint | ✅ ENFORCED |
| Moonlighting | Included in 80h | ✅ ENFORCED |
| Minimum rest | FRMS monitoring | ⚠️ 8h (not 10h) |
| Call frequency | Template-based | ⚠️ Not hard constraint |

**Overall Compliance:** 6/8 fully enforced, 2/8 with gaps

### Best Practices Beyond Requirements
- Proactive duty hour monitoring (not just reactive)
- Weekly compliance reports (exceeds annual requirement)
- Automated violation prevention
- Wellness as core constraint
- Fatigue risk assessment
- Historical data for accreditation reviews

---

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority
1. **Verify minimum rest hours:** Clarify ACGME requirement (10 vs 8 hours)
2. **Add call frequency constraint:** Enforce every-3rd-night rule programmatically
3. **Update RAG knowledge base:** Document night float 6-night limit

### Medium Priority
1. **Post-call activity restrictions:** Consider scheduling enforcement (currently operational only)
2. **Expand contagion monitoring:** Integrate into daily health checks
3. **Calibration roadmap:** Plan how historical burnout data will train models

### Low Priority
1. **Dashboard enhancement:** Add drill-down to individual risk factors
2. **Program analytics:** Track intervention effectiveness over time
3. **Research publication:** Document wellness framework for medical literature
