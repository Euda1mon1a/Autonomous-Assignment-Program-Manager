***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Critical User Journey Coverage

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1. Authentication Flow (45+ tests)

**Journey:** Visitor → Login → Dashboard → Protected Routes → Logout

```
✅ Happy Path:
  - Login with valid credentials → redirect to dashboard
  - Session persistence across page refresh
  - Navigation across pages maintains session
  - Logout clears session & auth cookie
  - Protected route access restricted to authenticated users

✅ Unhappy Paths:
  - Invalid credentials → error message + stay on login page
  - Empty username/password → validation error
  - Rapid consecutive attempts → button disabled
  - Special characters in inputs → handled gracefully
  - Network errors during login → error handling

✅ Security Tests:
  - XSS attempts in username/password → sanitized
  - SQL injection in credentials → rejected
  - Password field remains type="password" (not exposed)
  - Auth token in httpOnly cookies (not JavaScript accessible)
  - No sensitive data in localStorage or URL params
  - No password/credential leakage in error messages
  - Invalid token → redirect to login
  - Already authenticated users visiting /login → redirect to dashboard
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Flakiness Analysis

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Potential Problem Areas

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1. **High Risk - Swap Workflow (Race Conditions)**

```typescript
Problem: Executing swaps with multiple approvers simultaneously
- Two coordinators might approve same swap concurrently
- Race condition between approval and execution
- Potential double-execution

Symptoms:
- Swap appears executed twice
- Schedule corruption on both sides
- Test passes locally but fails in CI

Mitigation Needed:
- Add database-level constraint checking
- E2E test with concurrent swap attempts
- Mock delay to expose race conditions
```

**Current Test Gap:** No concurrency test in swap-workflow.spec.ts

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2. **Medium Risk - Schedule Generation Timing**

```typescript
Problem: Schedule generation is async and potentially long-running
- Solver can take 30+ seconds on large schedules
- Timeout value is 10000ms (may be too short)
- CI slowness can cause timeouts

Symptoms:
- "Generate Schedule" modal doesn't appear in time
- Schedule generation test times out
- Passes locally with faster CPU

Current Timeouts:
- waitForURL: 10000ms (10 seconds)
- Dialog appearance: 5000ms (5 seconds)
- These may be too aggressive for CI

Mitigation:
- Increase timeouts for slow tests
- Add progress indicator monitoring
- Mock schedule generation for fast tests
```

**Timeout Evidence:** 9 uses of `{ timeout: 10000 }` in schedule.spec.ts

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3. **Medium Risk - Calendar/Date Interactions**

```typescript
Problem: Date pickers and calendar components are notoriously flaky
- Timezone differences (local vs. UTC)
- Month navigation timing issues
- Calendar grid rendering delays

Symptoms:
- "should navigate between months in calendar" fails intermittently
- Dates appear but interactions don't register
- Mobile calendar taps miss targets

Current Safeguards:
- `page.waitForTimeout(500)` after calendar interactions
- Most tests check existence, not interaction results

Mitigation Needed:
- Add explicit wait for calendar rendering
- Verify visual state after navigation
- Test timezone handling explicitly
```

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (5+ calendar-related tests could be flaky)

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4. **Low Risk - Authentication**

```typescript
Auth tests are solid because:
- Login/logout are critical paths
- Tests are deterministic (no external data)
- Clear success criteria (URL navigation)
- httpOnly cookie security verified

No flakiness observed:
- No test.only or test.skip
- No timeout adjustments needed
- All assertions are stable
```

---

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Coverage Gaps & Missing Tests

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Critical Paths NOT Adequately Tested

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1. **Performance Under Load**
- No tests for concurrent users
- No tests for large dataset rendering (1000+ residents)
- No scheduler timeout behavior testing
- **Recommendation:** Add k6 load tests or concurrent Playwright tests

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2. **Error Recovery**
- Server errors (500) handled in auth.spec.ts
- Network interruptions tested in auth.spec.ts
- But limited in other domains (schedule, compliance)
- **Recommendation:** Add error recovery to all critical paths

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3. **Data Integrity After Operations**
- Create operations tested
- But no verification of correct data persistence after complex workflows
- E.g., create swap → approve → execute → verify both schedules changed
- **Recommendation:** Add database verification assertions

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4. **Credential/Certification Validation**
- Slot-type invariants not tested in E2E
- Hard/soft credential requirements not validated
- **Recommendation:** Add test for person without required creds can't be assigned

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 5. **ACGME Violation Scenarios**
- Compliance page tested for display
- But not for actual violation creation and remediation
- **Recommendation:** Create residents → assign shifts → trigger violations → fix

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 6. **Timezone Handling**
- No tests for UTC vs. local time display
- Absence dates might be wrong with timezone offset
- **Recommendation:** Add timezone-aware tests

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 7. **Multi-Language/Accessibility**
- No WCAG testing
- No screen reader verification
- No keyboard navigation tests
- **Recommendation:** Add Axe accessibility checks

  - Add environment-based timeout scaling

- [ ] **Add credential validation test** - Verify hard constraint enforcement
  - File: `frontend/e2e/tests/schedule-management.spec.ts`
  - Assign person without required cred → expect failure

- [ ] **Add ACGME violation creation test** - End-to-end compliance verification
  - File: `frontend/e2e/tests/compliance.spec.ts`
  - Create scenario that violates 80-hour rule
  - Verify violation appears on dashboard

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2. **Short Term (Medium Priority)**

- [ ] **Add custom health check** - Backend readiness before test start

---

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Playwright Configuration Analysis

**File:** `/frontend/playwright.config.ts`

```typescript
✅ Good Practices:
- Base URL set to localhost:3000
- Trace collection on first retry
- Screenshots on failure only
- HTML reporter for results
- Uses parallel execution (5 workers local, 1 worker CI)
- Auto-starts dev server (npm run dev)
- Retries disabled locally (faster feedback)
- Retries enabled on CI (handles flakiness)

⚠️ Potential Issues:
- Single browser (Chromium) - No Firefox/Safari testing
- screenshot: 'only-on-failure' - Can't debug passing tests visually
- No custom reporter for CI integration
- No API server dependency verification
- Dev server timeout: 120 seconds (may need increase for slow systems)

🚀 Optimization Opportunities:
- Add devices for iPhone/iPad testing (currently via viewport)
- Add pre-test health check for backend API
- Add custom reporter for GitHub Actions
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Critical Findings

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** What's Working Well ✅

1. **Comprehensive auth security testing** - XSS, SQL injection, token handling, httpOnly cookies
2. **Complete workflow coverage** - All major user journeys have E2E tests
3. **Good page object pattern** - 10 reusable page classes reduce maintenance burden
4. **Mobile responsiveness** - Dedicated tests for iPhone SE and iPad Mini
5. **Error handling** - Server errors, network issues, and graceful degradation tested
6. **No test pollution** - No test.skip or test.only; all tests execute
7. **Clear timeout strategy** - Consistent use of 10000ms for navigation, 5000ms for modals

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** What Needs Attention ⚠️

1. **Race conditions in swap execution** - No concurrent user tests
2. **Schedule generation timing** - 10000ms timeout may be too aggressive for CI
3. **Missing credential validation** - Slot-type invariants not tested
4. **No ACGME violation creation** - Compliance is tested for display, not behavior
5. **No accessibility testing** - Zero WCAG/screen reader coverage
6. **Limited error scenario testing** - Only auth has comprehensive error handling
7. **No timezone handling tests** - Absence dates could be wrong
