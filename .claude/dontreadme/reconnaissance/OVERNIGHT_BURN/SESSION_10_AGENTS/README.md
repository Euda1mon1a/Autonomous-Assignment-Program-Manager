## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **G-Staff Incomplete** (50%)
   - Missing: G3_OPERATIONS, G5_PLANS
   - Impact: No dedicated operations or strategic planning

2. **No Workflow Orchestrators** (0 agents)
   - Missing: INCIDENT_ORCHESTRATOR, STAGE_MANAGER, CROSS_DOMAIN_PLANNER
   - Impact: All multi-step workflows route to ORCHESTRATOR

3. **Orphaned Specialists** (8 agents)
   - Missing: Coordinators for data, analytics, learning
   - Impact: Good agents underutilized, unclear reporting

4. **Validator Shortage** (1 agent)
   - Missing: Dedicated compliance validator
   - Impact: Validation scattered across multiple agents

5. **Detection Without Action** (Burnout)
   - Missing: BURNOUT_RESPONDER
   - Impact: Alerts detected but interventions don't happen

## Recommended Solution

### Phase 1: Critical (Week 1-2)
**Agents:** G3_OPERATIONS, ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYST, INCIDENT_ORCHESTRATOR
**Impact:** +40% workflow improvement

### Phase 2: High-Priority (Week 3-4)
**Agents:** STAGE_MANAGER, COMPLIANCE_VALIDATOR, DEPLOYMENT_VERIFIER
**Impact:** +20% UX improvement, safety gates

### Phase 3: Medium-Priority (Week 5-6)
**Agents:** BURNOUT_RESPONDER, CROSS_DOMAIN_PLANNER, TREND_ANALYST, others
**Impact:** +15% specialization improvement
