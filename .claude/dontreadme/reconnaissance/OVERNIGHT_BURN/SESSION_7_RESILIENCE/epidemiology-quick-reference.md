## Intervention Checklist by Status

### 🟢 GREEN (Rt < 0.5)
```
☐ Routine monitoring continues
☐ No special interventions needed
☐ Maintain current preventive measures
☐ Review next quarter
```

### 🟡 YELLOW (Rt 0.5-1.0)
```
☐ Increase monitoring (weekly)
☐ Offer voluntary support groups
☐ Assess workload distribution
☐ Strengthen peer networks
☐ If Rt increases > 10%, escalate to ORANGE
```

### 🟠 ORANGE (Rt 1.0-1.5)
```
☐ Activate contact tracing protocol
☐ Identify all close contacts
☐ Assess contact loads (plan interventions)

```

## Super-Spreader Identification Checklist

**Calculate Superspreader Score:**
```
Score = (Centrality × 0.4) + (Load × 0.3) + (Duration × 0.2) + (Betweenness × 0.1)
```

**Threshold:**
- Score >0.7 = CRITICAL SUPER-SPREADER
- Score >0.5 = MODERATE SUPER-SPREADER
- Score >0.3 = MONITOR

**Intervention for CRITICAL:**
```
☐ Immediate workload reduction 50%
☐ Remove high-visibility roles (coordinator, etc.)
☐ Assign peer buddy for support
☐ Mental health professional (mandatory)
☐ Blast radius isolation (schedule separation)
☐ Consider mandatory leave (1-2 weeks)
☐ Weekly check-ins (not supervisory)
☐ Monitor closely for recovery or departure
```

## Contact Tracing Quick Protocol

**When Burnout Detected (Load >70):**

1. **Trace** → Get swap partners (past 4 weeks)
2. **Assess** → Check each contact's load:
   - >60 = Already burned out (CRITICAL)
   - 45-60 = Exposed high-risk (HIGH)
   - 30-45 = Exposed moderate-risk (MEDIUM)
   - <30 = Low risk (LOW)
3. **Intervene** → Based on risk level:
   - **CRITICAL:** Same burnout protocol
   - **HIGH:** Workload reduction, weekly monitoring
   - **MEDIUM:** Enhanced monitoring, resources offered
   - **LOW:** Routine monitoring
4. **Monitor** → Weekly load checks for 4-6 weeks
5. **Escalate** → If contact load increases >5 points/week

---

## Syndromic Surveillance Screening

**Calculate Syndrome Score** (0-1.0):
```
Score = (swap↑ × 0.2) + (sick↑ × 0.2) + (performance↓ × 0.25) + (social↓ × 0.2) + (sentiment↓ × 0.15)
```

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- [ ] Swap requests UP 3x (offloading)
- [ ] Swap acceptance DOWN 50% (refusing help)
- [ ] Sick calls 3+ in 30 days
- [ ] Email delays (48+ hours)
- [ ] Chart backlog (3+ days)
- [ ] Meeting absences increasing
- [ ] Communication more negative
- [ ] Withdrawn from social activities

**Action by Score:**
- **>0.7** = CRITICAL → Immediate intervention
- **0.5-0.7** = HIGH → Early intervention (before full burnout)
- **0.3-0.5** = MODERATE → Monitor + offer resources
- **<0.3** = LOW → Routine monitoring

## Herd Immunity Calculation

**What is immunity?**
- Allostatic load <30 (capacity to absorb stress)
- Can help others without self-sacrifice

**Calculate Threshold:**
```
Herd Immunity Threshold = 1 - (1 / Rt)

Example: Rt = 1.8 → HIT = 1 - (1/1.8) = 0.44 (need 44% immune)
```

**Current Immunity Rate:**
```
Immune Faculty = Count(Load < 30) / Total
```

**Gap Analysis:**
```
If Immunity Rate < HIT:
  Gap = HIT - Immunity Rate
  Faculty Needed = Gap × Total
  Action: Increase capacity in Gap × Total faculty
```

---

## Load Trend Analysis

**Daily Load Changes:**
```
Δ < 1 point/day  = Gradual (normal)
1-2 points/day   = Moderate increase (monitor)
2-3 points/day   = Rapid increase (intervene)
>3 points/day    = Acute crisis (emergency)
```

**Time to Burnout (if linear trend):**
```
Days to Burnout = (60 - Current Load) / Daily Change Rate

Example: Load 48, changing +2/day
  Days to Burnout = (60-48)/2 = 6 days
  Action: IMMEDIATE intervention (don't wait for load>60)
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor Weekly

```
Weekly Surveillance Checklist:

Epidemiology:
  ☐ Current Rt value
  ☐ Rt trend (increasing/stable/decreasing)
  ☐ New burnout cases (load >60)
  ☐ New at-risk cases (load 40-60)

Super-spreaders:
  ☐ Top 3 high-risk faculty by score
  ☐ Their current loads
  ☐ Improvement in burnout duration?

Contact Tracing:
  ☐ Active traced contacts: count
  ☐ Load trends in contacts
  ☐ Any contacts crossed into burned-out?

Herd Immunity:
  ☐ % with load <30 (immune)
  ☐ Gap to herd immunity threshold
  ☐ Faculty improved this week?

Overall System:
  ☐ Utilization % (goal: <80%)
  ☐ Variance in allostatic loads (should decrease)
  ☐ Any new departures/attrition signals?

       │                   ├─ YES → Continue RED
       │                   └─ NO → ESCALATE TO BLACK
       │
       └─ Rt > 2.5?  ──→ BLACK   (emergency ALL STOPS)
                           │
                           └─ Daily tracking until Rt < 1.5

ESCALATION RULE:
  No improvement in status within interval → Escalate 1 level
```

## Clinical Decision Tree

**New Faculty with High Load (>60):**

```
Load > 60?
├─ YES
│  ├─ Load 60-70?  → Burnout (mild) → Workload reduction
│  ├─ Load 70-80?  → Burnout (moderate) → Mandatory support + leave
│  └─ Load >80?    → Burnout (severe) → Leave + crisis support
│
├─ Trace contacts
│  ├─ Contact load >60? → Already burned out (intervene)
│  ├─ 45-60?          → Exposed high-risk (prevent progression)
│  └─ <45?            → Monitor (prevent exposure)
│
└─ Review for super-spreader status
   ├─ High centrality + high load? → URGENT intervention
   └─ Low centrality?              → Standard protocol
```
