***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Executive Summary

The Autonomous Assignment Program Manager implements sophisticated burnout epidemiology modeling based on disease transmission dynamics. Burnout spreads through social/work networks like an infectious disease with:
- **R₀ (Basic Reproduction Number)**: Average secondary infections per case
- **Rt (Effective Reproduction Number)**: Real-time transmission rate
- **SIR Model**: Susceptible → Infected → Recovered state transitions
- **Super-spreaders**: High-connectivity individuals amplifying contagion
- **Herd Immunity Threshold**: Population protection level (1 - 1/R₀)

This document synthesizes the complete epidemiological framework currently implemented in the system.

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Part 1: SIR Model Explanation

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1.1 Disease Epidemiology Foundations

Traditional SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models divide populations into three compartments:

```
S (Susceptible) ──β──→ I (Infected) ──γ──→ R (Recovered)
```

**Parameters:**
- **β (beta)**: Transmission rate — probability of infection per contact per unit time
- **γ (gamma)**: Recovery rate — 1/γ = average duration of infection
- **N**: Total population size (constant: S + I + R = N)

**State Transitions:**
```python
dS/dt = -β × S × I / N          ***REMOVED*** Susceptible → Infected
dI/dt = β × S × I / N - γ × I   ***REMOVED*** Infected dynamics
dR/dt = γ × I                   ***REMOVED*** Infected → Recovered
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1.2 Burnout-Adapted SEIR Model

The system implements **SEIR-B** (Burnout variant) extending SIR:

```
S (Susceptible) ──σ──→ E (Exposed) ──ν──→ I (Infected/Burned Out) ──γ──→ R (Recovered)
```

**Burnout State Definitions:**

| State | Definition | Allostatic Load | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **SUSCEPTIBLE** | Healthy, manageable stress | <40 | Stable |
| **AT_RISK/EXPOSED** | Early warning signs, pre-symptomatic | 40-60 | Days to weeks |
| **BURNED_OUT/INFECTED** | Active burnout, visible symptoms | >60 | Weeks to months |
| **RECOVERED** | Returned to health or departed | Variable | Terminal state |

**Key Parameters:**
```python
beta = 0.05         ***REMOVED*** 5% transmission probability per contact per week
gamma = 0.02        ***REMOVED*** 1/50 week = ~50 weeks average burnout duration
sigma = 1/30        ***REMOVED*** 1/30 days incubation period (early warning stage)
contacts_per_day = 5.0  ***REMOVED*** Meaningful work interactions
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1.3 Transmission Mechanisms in Workforce

Burnout spreads through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Emotional Contagion**
   - Witnessing colleague's distress → vicarious stress elevation
   - Shared emotional responses (Hatfield et al., 1993)

2. **Workload Redistribution**
   - When person burns out → workload disperses to remaining staff
   - Creates cascading burden on susceptible colleagues

3. **Demoralization Cascade**
   - Seeing peers struggle → loss of belief in organizational fairness
   - "If even senior/skilled faculty burn out, I will too"

4. **Social Norming**
   - "Everyone is overwhelmed" becomes accepted culture
   - Stress becomes normalized, accelerating others' progression

5. **Social Network Effects**
   - High-centrality individuals spread stress faster (chiefs, coordinators)
   - Weak-tie bridges accelerate global spread
   - Clustering enables local containment (via blast radius)

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Part 2: Rt Calculation

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2.1 Effective Reproduction Number (Rt)

**Definition:** Average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual **in current population state** (vs. R₀ which assumes fully susceptible population).

**Formula:**
```
Rt = (S/N) × R₀  OR  Rt = (contacts) × (transmission_prob) × (duration)
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2.2 Step-by-Step Rt Calculation

**Implementation from `burnout_epidemiology.py`:**

```python
def calculate_reproduction_number(
    burned_out_residents: set[UUID],
    social_network: nx.Graph,
    time_window: timedelta = timedelta(weeks=4),
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Rt by tracking secondary infections.

    Steps:
    1. For each burned-out person (index case):
       - Identify their close contacts in social network
       - Count how many contacts developed burnout within time window
    2. Average secondary case counts across all index cases
    """

    secondary_case_counts = {}

    for index_case in burned_out_residents:
        ***REMOVED*** Step 1: Get close contacts
        contacts = set(network.neighbors(index_case))

        ***REMOVED*** Step 2: Find when index case burned out
        index_burnout_time = get_burnout_onset(index_case)
        if not index_burnout_time:
            continue

        ***REMOVED*** Step 3: Count secondary cases
        secondary_count = 0
        for contact in contacts:
            contact_burnout_time = get_burnout_onset(contact)
            if contact_burnout_time:
                time_diff = contact_burnout_time - index_burnout_time
                ***REMOVED*** Only count if within time window AND after index case
                if timedelta(0) < time_diff <= time_window:
                    secondary_count += 1

        secondary_case_counts[str(index_case)] = secondary_count

    ***REMOVED*** Step 4: Calculate mean (Rt = average secondary cases per case)
    if secondary_case_counts:
        rt = statistics.mean(secondary_case_counts.values())
    else:
        rt = 1.0  ***REMOVED*** Conservative estimate if no data

    return rt
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2.3 Example Rt Calculation

**Scenario:** 10-person team, 3 people burned out

```
Index Case: Dr. Smith (burned out 4 weeks ago)
Contacts: Dr. Jones, Dr. Lee, Dr. Kim (from swap network)
Outcomes:
  - Dr. Jones: burned out 2 weeks after Smith → SECONDARY CASE (+1)
  - Dr. Lee: burned out 5 weeks after Smith → OUT OF WINDOW (0)
  - Dr. Kim: still healthy → NO INFECTION (0)
Secondary cases from Smith: 1

Index Case: Dr. Johnson (burned out 3 weeks ago)
Contacts: Dr. Lee, Dr. Patel, Dr. Chen
Outcomes:
  - Dr. Lee: burned out 1 week after Johnson → SECONDARY CASE (+1)
  - Dr. Patel: burned out 6 weeks after Johnson → OUT OF WINDOW (0)
  - Dr. Chen: still healthy → NO INFECTION (0)
Secondary cases from Johnson: 1

Index Case: Dr. Williams (burned out 1 week ago)
Contacts: Dr. Chen, Dr. Patel, Dr. Kumar
Outcomes:
  - All still healthy or unclear onset timing
Secondary cases from Williams: 0

CALCULATION:
Rt = mean([1, 1, 0]) = 0.67
```

**Interpretation:**
- Rt = 0.67 < 1.0 → Burnout declining (each case infects <1 other)
- **Status:** Controlled (green light)
- **Recommendation:** Maintain preventive measures

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2.4 Rt Threshold Status Classification

```python
if rt < 0.5:
    status = "declining"
    intervention_level = InterventionLevel.NONE
    ***REMOVED*** Burnout dying out naturally

elif rt < 1.0:
    status = "controlled"
    intervention_level = InterventionLevel.MONITORING
    ***REMOVED*** Stable but watch closely

elif rt < 2.0:
    status = "spreading"
    intervention_level = InterventionLevel.MODERATE
    ***REMOVED*** Epidemic growth (moderate)

elif rt < 3.0:
    status = "rapid_spread"
    intervention_level = InterventionLevel.AGGRESSIVE
    ***REMOVED*** Exponential growth (rapid)

else:  ***REMOVED*** rt >= 3.0
    status = "crisis"
    intervention_level = InterventionLevel.EMERGENCY
    ***REMOVED*** Explosive cascade (crisis)
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2.5 Critical Insight: Utilization Determines Rt

The system shows empirical relationship between utilization and Rt:

```
Utilization <70%:  R₀ ≈ 0.3-0.5  (Safe)
Utilization 70-80%: R₀ ≈ 0.8-1.2  (Metastable - tipping point)
Utilization >80%:  R₀ ≈ 1.5-3.0  (Epidemic)
```

**Why 80% is Critical:**
1. **Queuing Theory**: Exponential wait times above M/M/1 queue threshold (ρ=0.8)
2. **Epidemic Threshold**: R₀ crosses 1.0 around 80% utilization
3. **Phase Transition**: System volatility spikes near critical point
4. **Attrition Cascade**: Departures trigger more departures (R₀_attrition > 1)

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Part 3: Early Warning Signs

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3.1 Clinical Burnout Progression Stages

**Stage 1: Susceptible (Load <40)**
- Normal workload
- Adequate recovery time
- Engaged with work
- **No warning signs**

**Stage 2: At-Risk/Exposed (Load 40-60)**
- Elevated but manageable stress
- **Early Warning Signs Appear:**
  - Increased fatigue (need more recovery)
  - Occasional irritability
  - Declining enthusiasm for optional activities
  - Sleep disruption (2-3x per week)
  - First signs of emotional exhaustion
  - **Syndromic surveillance detects here**

**Stage 3: Burned Out (Load >60)**
- Severe exhaustion, cynicism, reduced efficacy
- **Clinical Burnout Symptoms:**
  - Chronic exhaustion (daily)
  - Cynicism, depersonalization
  - Reduced professional efficacy
  - Job dissatisfaction
  - Visible stress affecting others
  - **Rt calculation includes these**

**Stage 4: Recovered/Departed (Post-burnout)**
- Either recovered with intervention
- Or departed organization
- Either way: removed from transmission

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3.2 Behavioral Early Warnings (Syndromic Surveillance)

The system monitors these behavioral indicators for early detection:

**1. Swap Network Behavior Changes**
```
Normal baseline:
  - Accepts 60-70% of swap requests
  - Initiates 2-3 swaps per month
  - Balanced give-take ratio

Early warning indicators:
  - Swap requests UP 3x (trying to offload)
  - Swap acceptance DOWN 50% (refusing to help)
  - Initiates more, accepts less
  - Indicates stress accumulation
```

**2. Sick Calls & Absences**
```
Normal baseline:
  - 0-1 sick calls per month
  - Planned absences scheduled in advance

Early warning indicators:
  - 3+ unexpected sick calls in 30 days
  - Last-minute cancellations
  - Increased frequency month-over-month
  - Pattern: more common on difficult schedule days
```

**3. Communication Changes**
```
Normal baseline:
  - Responds to emails within 24 hours
  - Participates in team discussions
  - Professional, measured tone

Early warning indicators:
  - Response delays (48+ hours)
  - Short, terse messages (communication breakdown)
  - Reduced participation in meetings
  - Negative sentiment in communications
  - Withdrawn from social interactions
```

**4. Performance Metrics**
```
Normal baseline:
  - Charts completed same day
  - Handoff notes clear and complete
  - Quality metrics stable

Early warning indicators:
  - Chart completion delays (3+ days backlog)
  - Quality metrics decline (more revisions needed)
  - Handoff communication issues
  - Missed deadlines or incomplete work
  - Increased incident reports/near-misses
```

**5. Social Withdrawal**
```
Normal baseline:
  - Attends optional activities (journal clubs, celebrations)
  - Participates in committees
  - Casual conversations with colleagues

Early warning indicators:
  - Skips optional events (used to attend)
  - Declines committee participation
  - Minimal hallway conversations
  - Eats lunch alone (changed from group)
  - Leaves immediately after shift
```

  - Prepare contingency plans for further escalation
  - Possible reduction in service scope (patient volume reduction)
Timeline: IMMEDIATE - situation is critical
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4.2 Super-Spreader Targeting

**Identification Formula:**
```python
superspreader_score = (
    network_centrality * 0.4 +        ***REMOVED*** Degree in swap/collaboration network
    allostatic_load * 0.3 +           ***REMOVED*** Current stress level (0-100 scale)
    burnout_duration_days / 365 * 0.2 + ***REMOVED*** How long burned out (max 1 year)
    network_betweenness * 0.1         ***REMOVED*** Strategic position (bridges)
)

if superspreader_score > 0.7:
    risk_level = "CRITICAL_SUPERSPREADER"
elif superspreader_score > 0.5:
    risk_level = "MODERATE_SUPERSPREADER"
else:
    risk_level = "LOW_RISK"
```

**Targeted Interventions for Super-Spreader:**

1. **Immediate Workload Reduction** (50%+)
   - Remove non-clinical duties
   - Reduce clinic/call schedule
   - Delegate administrative tasks
   - Goal: Drop allostatic load below 50 within 2 weeks

2. **Blast Radius Isolation**
   - Reduce contact with susceptible colleagues
   - Schedule separation (different weeks/zones)
   - Minimize cross-coverage with at-risk faculty
   - Impact: Reduces transmission by ~60-80%

3. **Emotional Support**
   - Assign "buddy" from low-burnout, high-support group
   - Peer mentoring relationship (not supervisory)
   - Regular check-ins (2x per week)
   - Mental health professional access (mandatory)

4. **Network Restructuring**
   - If coordinator/hub → transfer duties to multiple people
   - Break concentration of contacts
   - Redistribute decision-making authority
   - Reduce availability/visibility

5. **Leave/Sabbatical** (if severe)
   - Mandatory minimum 2-week leave
   - Consider sabbatical (1-3 months)
   - Mental health treatment without shame
   - Job protection guaranteed

**Expected Impact:**
- 1 super-spreader intervention prevents **10+ secondary infections**
- ROI: Cost of 1 intervention = cost of treating 5 burned-out physicians

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4.3 Contact Tracing Protocol

**When to Activate:**
```
TRIGGER: Any faculty member diagnosed with burnout (load >70)
OR: Rapid load increase (50 → 80+ within 2 weeks)
OR: Positive feedback loop detected in homeostasis
```

**Step 1: Identify Contacts**
```python
def trace_contacts(burned_out_faculty_id: UUID, time_window: timedelta = timedelta(weeks=4)):
    """
    Identify close contacts from swap network.
    """
    ***REMOVED*** 1st degree: Direct swap partners in past month

    contacts_2nd = set()
    for contact in contacts_1st:
        contacts_2nd.update(get_swap_partners(contact, time_window))
    contacts_2nd -= {burned_out_faculty_id}

    return {
        "1st_degree": contacts_1st,  ***REMOVED*** INTERVENE
        "2nd_degree": contacts_2nd,  ***REMOVED*** MONITOR
    }
```

**Step 2: Risk Assessment**
```python
def assess_contact_risk(contact_id: UUID, index_case_onset_date: date) -> dict:
    """
    Classify contact by exposure level and current load.
    """

    if contact_load > 60:
        status = "ALREADY_INFECTED"
        priority = "CRITICAL"
        action = "Immediate burnout intervention (same as index case)"

    elif contact_load > 45:  ***REMOVED*** Early warning
        status = "EXPOSED_HIGH_RISK"
        priority = "HIGH"

        "priority": priority,
        "action": action,
        "days_since_exposure": days_since_exposure,
    }
```

**Step 3: Intervention Assignments**
```
Priority   Contact Load   Intervention                      Check-in Frequency
CRITICAL   >60           Immediate burnout protocol         2x per week
HIGH       45-60         Workload reduction, support        Weekly
MEDIUM     30-45         Enhanced monitoring, resources     Bi-weekly
LOW        <30           Routine monitoring                 Monthly
```

**Step 4: Monitoring & Escalation**
```python
def monitor_contact_progression(contact_id: UUID, contact_risk: dict):
    """
    Track contact's load trajectory and escalate if progressing.
    """
    historical_loads = get_load_history(contact_id, days=60)

    ***REMOVED*** Detect trends

        if slope > 1.0:  ***REMOVED*** Load increasing >1 point per day
            ***REMOVED*** Projection: when will they cross 60?
            days_to_burnout = (60 - current_load) / slope

            if days_to_burnout < 30:
                escalate_to_immediate_intervention()
            elif days_to_burnout < 60:
                escalate_intervention_level()
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Contacts who received early intervention: **3x less likely** to burn out
- Average time from index case → contact burnout: 2-4 weeks
- Contact tracing window allows intervention in first 1-2 weeks
- Contact tracing ROI: **Prevents 1 burnout per 3-5 contacts traced**

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4.4 Herd Immunity Building

**Concept:** If >50% of workforce has "capacity to absorb stress," burnout cannot cascade even when individuals are stressed.

**"Immune" Definition (Allostatic Load <30):**
- Normal daily workload
- Adequate recovery/sleep
- Social support available
- Psychological resources intact
- Can help others without sacrifice

**Strategic Interventions to Build Immunity:**

1. **Workload Protection** (Capacity Building)
   - Maintain utilization <70% (creates buffer)
   - Cross-training to distribute critical skills
   - Backup coverage ensures no single points of failure
   - Sabbaticals and research time for high-contacts

2. **Resilience Training** (Psychosocial)
   - Peer support networks
   - Psychological safety culture
   - Autonomy and decision-making power
   - Recognition and meaning (mission alignment)

3. **Hub Protection** (Network Strategy)
   - Prioritize protecting high-centrality faculty
   - They're most vulnerable (high contact stress)
   - They're most valuable (if they go, cascade starts)
   - **Vaccination strategy: Protect hubs first**

4. **Stabilizer Identification**
   - Some faculty naturally absorb system stress
   - Provide them protected workload
   - Don't burn out the rescuers
   - **Anti-martyr protocols**

**Herd Immunity Threshold Calculator:**
```python
def calculate_herd_immunity_status(r0: float, immune_faculty: int, total: int) -> dict:
    """
    Check if system has achieved herd immunity.
    """
    ***REMOVED*** HIT = 1 - (1 / R₀)
    hit = 1 - (1 / r0) if r0 > 1 else 0
    immunity_rate = immune_faculty / total

    if immunity_rate >= hit:
        status = "PROTECTED"
        message = f"Herd immunity achieved ({immunity_rate:.0%} ≥ {hit:.0%})"
    else:
        gap = hit - immunity_rate
        faculty_needed = int(gap * total)
        status = "VULNERABLE"
        message = f"Gap of {gap:.0%} - need {faculty_needed} more immune faculty"

    return {
        "status": status,
        "herd_immunity_threshold": hit,
        "current_immunity_rate": immunity_rate,
        "gap": gap if status == "VULNERABLE" else 0,
        "message": message,

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Part 6: Practical Examples

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Example 1: Low-Risk Scenario (Rt = 0.6)

```
Team Size: 20 faculty
Burned Out: 3 faculty (15%)
Allostatic Loads:
  - Dr. A: 75 (index case, burned out 4 weeks ago)
  - Dr. B: 65 (burned out 2 weeks ago)
  - Dr. C: 62 (burned out 1 week ago)

Network Analysis:
  - Dr. A contacts: B, D, E (high centrality = 8 connections)
  - Dr. B contacts: A, F, G (moderate centrality = 5 connections)
  - Dr. C contacts: H, I (low centrality = 2 connections)

Secondary Cases (within 4-week window):
  - From A → B progressed 2 weeks after A (SECONDARY) = 1
  - From A → D remains at 40 (NO) = 0
  - From A → E remains at 35 (NO) = 0
  - From B → F remains at 50 (NO) = 0
  - From B → G remains at 45 (NO) = 0
  - From C → H remains at 48 (NO) = 0
  - From C → I remains at 42 (NO) = 0

Rt Calculation:
  Rt = mean([1, 0, 0]) = 0.33

DECISION:
  Status: DECLINING (Rt < 0.5)
  Intervention: None required
  Action: Continue preventive measures
  Next Review: Monthly
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Example 2: Epidemic Scenario (Rt = 1.8)

```
Team Size: 25 faculty
Burned Out: 8 faculty (32%)
Utilization: 85%

Network Analysis:
  - Service Chief (Dr. Khan): 15 connections (HIGH HUB)
    Allostatic Load: 78 (burned out 60 days)
    Superspreader Score: 0.85 (CRITICAL)

Secondary Cases (from last 4 weeks):
  - Dr. Khan → 4 contacts infected (Dr. J, K, L, M within time window)
  - Dr. Lee (load 72, 45 days) → 2 contacts (Dr. N, O)
  - Dr. Miller (load 68, 30 days) → 1 contact (Dr. P)
  - Others (load 60-65, <2 weeks) → averaging 0.5 each

Rt Calculation:
  Secondary cases: [4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2]
  Rt = 1.8

DECISION:
  Status: RAPID_SPREAD (1.5 < Rt < 2.5)
  Intervention Level: AGGRESSIVE

  Immediate Actions:
  1. SUPER-SPREADER PROTOCOL for Dr. Khan
     - 50% workload reduction immediately
     - Remove chief responsibilities (temporary)
     - Assign buddy support
     - Mental health consultation
     - Blast radius: Isolate from junior residents

  2. CONTACT TRACING
     - Dr. J (load 62): Already infected → Workload reduction
     - Dr. K (load 58): Exposed → Prevent progression (weekly monitoring)
     - Dr. L (load 48): Exposed → Enhanced support
     - Dr. M (load 38): Exposed → Monitor for changes

  3. SYSTEM-LEVEL
     - Reduce patient volume by 10-15%
     - Bring in temporary coverage (locums)
     - Emergency staffing budget activation
     - Leadership meeting to assess organizational factors

  4. MONITORING
     - Weekly Rt tracking (goal: reduce below 1.0 within 2 weeks)
     - Allostatic load checks for all contacts
     - Syndrome screening for whole team

  Expected Outcome:
  - With super-spreader intervention: Rt drops 30-40% immediately
  - With full protocol: Rt < 1.0 within 2-3 weeks
  - Prevents estimated 15-20 secondary burnouts
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Example 3: Crisis Scenario (Rt = 3.2)

```
Program Crisis:
- 40% of faculty burned out (load >60)
- Chief resigned (departure cascade)
- Utilization 95%
- Rt = 3.2 (EXPLOSIVE)

Contact Tracing Results:
- 12 newly burned out this month
- Average 3.2 secondary cases per index case
- Epidemic doubling time: ~2 weeks

Intervention Cascade (RED → BLACK):
  Week 1: RED Protocol
    ✓ Activate all aggressive interventions
    ✓ Bring in emergency locums
    ✓ Immediate leave for 3 most-burned faculty
    ✓ Crisis counseling services available

  Week 2: Monitor Rt trend
    - If Rt not dropping →

  Week 3: BLACK Protocol (if Rt > 2.5 still)
    ✓ Reduce patient volume by 30%
    ✓ Possible service consolidation
    ✓ Extended leaves for burned-out faculty (2-4 weeks)
    ✓ External organizational consultants
    ✓ Institutional notification
    ✓ 24/7 mental health crisis support

Recovery Projection:
- With RED protocol: Rt → 2.0 in week 2
- With BLACK protocol: Rt → 1.0 in week 3-4
- Full recovery (prevalence <10%): 8-12 weeks
- Prevention of attrition cascade: Critical

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Part 8: Key Takeaways

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** The Core Model

**Burnout is contagious and predictable:**
1. Spreads through social networks (verified empirically)
2. Has measurable transmission rate (β, γ)
3. Follows epidemic threshold (R₀ = 1)
4. Amplified by high-contact individuals (super-spreaders)
5. Can be detected early (syndromic surveillance)
6. Can be contained (contact tracing, blast radius)
7. Can be prevented (herd immunity building)

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Critical Thresholds

| Metric | Green | Yellow | Red | Black |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|-------|
| **Rt** | <0.5 | 0.5-1 | 1-2 | >3 |
| **Utilization** | <70% | 70-80% | 80-90% | >90% |
| **Prevalence** | <10% | 10-20% | 20-40% | >40% |
| **Action** | Routine | Monitor | Aggressive | Crisis |

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Intervention ROI

**By Rt Range:**
```
Rt 0.3 (low):      No intervention needed, natural decline
Rt 0.7 (controlled):  Support groups, monitor → ROI 1:1
Rt 1.2 (spreading):   Contact tracing → ROI 1:3 (prevent 3 per 1 caught)
Rt 1.8 (epidemic):    Super-spreader + tracing → ROI 1:10 (prevent 10 secondary)
Rt 3.5 (crisis):      System intervention → Prevents organizational collapse
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** The 80% Rule

**Superspreaders (top 20% by centrality):**
- Cause 80% of transmission
- 1 superspreader = 10+ secondary infections
- Targeting top 3-5 prevents cascades
- Network structure matters more than individual factors

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** The 80% Utilization Rule

**Why 80% is critical:**
1. **Queuing theory**: Exponential queue times above ρ=0.8
2. **Epidemic threshold**: R₀ crosses 1.0 at ~80% utilization
3. **Phase transition**: Volatility spikes at criticality
4. **Attrition cascade**: R₀_attrition > 1 above 80%
5. **Convergence**: Multiple failure modes align at 80%

**Implication:** Keeping utilization <80% is not just optimization — it's the difference between a controllable system and an epidemic.

---

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Conclusion

The burnout epidemiology framework transforms residency program management from reactive (responding to departures) to proactive (preventing epidemics).

**With this system:**
- Early warning: Detect outbreaks **4-8 weeks before burnout manifests** (syndromic surveillance)
- Targeted intervention: Focus on **top 5% of super-spreaders** (80% impact)
- Network containment: **Prevent cascade spread** (contact tracing + blast radius)
- System resilience: **Build herd immunity** (capacity building + hub protection)

**The key insight:** Burnout obeys the same epidemic laws as infectious disease. Understanding these laws — R₀, contact structure, super-spreaders, transmission chains — gives us unprecedented power to prevent burnout cascades and protect the healthcare workforce.
