## Detailed Findings by Probe

### PERCEPTION: Test File Locations
```
✓ Backend tests clearly organized in /backend/tests/performance/
✓ Load tests in /load-tests/scenarios/ with modular structure
✓ Fixtures in conftest.py (standard pytest pattern)
✓ Configuration in k6.config.js (centralized)
```

### INVESTIGATION: Benchmark Coverage
```
✓ ACGME validation: 100, 50, 25 resident scaling
✓ Concurrency: 10 parallel operations tested
✓ Memory: Extreme scale (16.8K assignments) tested
✓ Connection pool: Saturation, recovery, leak detection
✓ Idempotency: 100 concurrent identical requests

✗ Swap operations: No load testing
✗ Resilience framework: No benchmarks
✗ MCP server: No performance tests
✗ Schedule generation: k6 only, no algorithm profiling
```

### ARCANA: Framework Patterns
```
pytest Patterns:
  ✓ Mark-based grouping (@pytest.mark.performance)
  ✓ Fixture-based data generation
  ✓ Context managers for timing (measure_time)
  ✓ Custom assertion helpers (assert_performance)

k6 Patterns:
  ✓ Stage-based load profiles
  ✓ Threshold-based pass/fail
  ✓ Custom metrics (Trend, Counter, Rate)
  ✓ Modular scenario design
```

### HISTORY: Performance Evolution
```
Current State (53 pytest tests):
  - Well-established ACGME validation testing
  - Recent emphasis on idempotency (9 tests)
  - Comprehensive connection pool coverage
  - No resilience framework testing
  - No swap operation testing
  - No MCP integration testing

Trajectory: Reactive (adding tests as features mature) → Proactive needed
```

### INSIGHT: SLA Requirements
```
ACGME Validation (pytest):
  - 100 residents, 4 weeks: < 5.0s
  - 50 residents, 4 weeks: < 2.0s
  - 25 residents, 2 weeks: < 1.0s
  - 10 concurrent validations: < 10.0s

API Endpoints (k6):
  - Standard GET: p95 < 500ms
  - Standard POST: p95 < 1000ms
  - Complex ops: p95 < 30s
  - Error rate: < 1%

Schedule Generation (k6):
  - Single run: < 30s (p95)
  - 10 concurrent: < 60s (p99)
  - Error rate: < 5% (complex operation)
```

### RELIGION: SLA Enforcement
```
✓ Clear threshold definitions in pytest
✓ Performance assertions trigger test failure
✓ k6 threshold markers on all tests
✓ Business justification documented in docstrings

Gap: No historical tracking or regression detection
Gap: No CI/CD enforcement of SLAs
Gap: Manual verification required
```

### NATURE: Over-optimization Assessment
```
Current SLAs: Realistic and defensible
  - ACGME validation: ≤5s reasonable for 5.6K assignments
  - Connection pool: Appropriate for production use
  - Idempotency: Adequate for network retry patterns
  - k6 thresholds: Aligned with production expectations

No over-optimization detected. SLAs are achievable.
```

### MEDICINE: Baseline Metrics
```
Established Baselines:
  ✓ ACGME validation: p50/p95/p99 for 3 dataset sizes
  ✓ API endpoints: 10 major endpoints profiled
  ✓ Schedule generation: Concurrent admin load tested
  ✓ Connection pool: Throughput and latency measured
  ✓ Idempotency: Concurrent request handling validated

Missing Baselines:
  ✗ Swap operations: No metrics
  ✗ Resilience framework: No metrics
  ✗ MCP server tools: No metrics
```

### SURVIVAL: Load Testing Coverage
```
Load Patterns Covered:
  ✓ Baseline (single user, 100 iterations)
  ✓ Sustained (constant VUs over time)
  ✓ Ramp (gradual increase/decrease)
  ✓ Peak (sudden high load)
  ✓ Spike (extreme burst)
  ✓ Soak (long-running, memory leak detection)

Load Patterns Missing:
  ✗ Failure injection (slow DB, Redis down)
  ✗ Cascading failures
  ✗ Recovery scenarios
```

### STEALTH: Untested Hot Paths
```
Critical Untested Paths:
  🔴 Swap execution (any load level)
  🔴 Resilience analysis (N-1/N-2 contingency)
  🔴 MCP tool execution (any volume)

Moderately Untested Paths:
  🟡 Schedule generation algorithm (unit-level profiling)
  🟡 API endpoint coverage (10/20+ endpoints)
  🟡 Failure scenarios (degradation testing)

High-Risk Operations:
  - Swap operations: No race condition testing
  - Resilience: Performance unknown at scale
  - MCP: Tool chaining latency untested
```

## Gap Impact Assessment

### CRITICAL Gaps (Must Fix Before Production)

**Gap 1: Swap Operations - 0 Load Tests**
```
Business Impact: HIGH (used daily by faculty/residents)
Data Integrity Risk: HIGH (schedule consistency critical)
Current State: Unit tests only, zero load validation

Risk Scenario:
  - 100 concurrent swap requests → performance unknown
  - Race condition on same shift → untested
  - Rollback consistency → unvalidated

Recommended Action:
  Create: test_swap_execution_load.py
  Tests: 4-5 (concurrent swaps, matching, rollback)
  Effort: 15-20 hours
  SLAs: < 500ms per swap (p95), 100% consistency
```

**Gap 2: Resilience Framework - 0 Benchmarks**
```
Business Impact: HIGH (system stability)
Data Integrity Risk: MEDIUM (affects decision-making)
Current State: Brand new framework, zero performance testing

Risk Scenario:
  - N-1 contingency analysis → latency unknown
  - Defense level scoring → performance uncharacterized
  - Circuit breaker → response time not measured

Recommended Action:
  Create: test_resilience_load.py
  Tests: 4-5 (N-1 analysis, defense levels, circuit breaker)
  Effort: 20-25 hours
  SLAs: < 5s for analysis, < 1s for scoring, < 500ms for CB
```

**Gap 3: MCP Server - 0 Performance Tests**
```
Business Impact: HIGH (core AI integration)
Data Integrity Risk: LOW (read-heavy)
Current State: Container running, unvalidated for performance

Risk Scenario:
  - Tool discovery overhead → unknown
  - Tool chaining latency → unmeasured
  - Concurrent tool execution → unvalidated

Recommended Action:
  Create: test_mcp_integration_performance.py
  Tests: 5-6 (discovery, execution, chaining, callbacks)
  Effort: 15-20 hours
  SLAs: < 500ms tool exec, < 2s for 3-level chain
```

### MODERATE Gaps (Should Complete Soon)

**Gap 4: API Endpoint Baseline Expansion**
```
Current: 10/20+ endpoints profiled
Missing: /api/swap/*, /api/resilience/*, /api/credentials, etc.
Effort: 8-10 hours
Action: Expand api-baseline.js with 10+ new endpoints
```

**Gap 5: Schedule Generation Algorithm Profiling**
```
Current: HTTP response time only (k6)
Missing: Solver iterations, constraint propagation, memory
Effort: 12-15 hours
Action: Create test_schedule_generation_profiling.py
```

**Gap 6: Failure Scenario Testing**
```
Current: Normal operation only
Missing: Slow DB, Redis down, worker failure, timeout handling
Effort: 10-12 hours
Action: Create test_resilience_failures.py
```

# Run specific test classes
pytest tests/performance/test_acgme_load.py::TestACGMEPerformance -v

# Run k6 load tests
cd load-tests
npm run test:smoke      # 1 minute baseline

```

---

## Conclusion

The codebase has **strong foundational performance testing** with 53 well-designed pytest tests and 8 load test scenarios covering major operations. However, **three critical gaps** must be closed before production deployment:

1. **Swap Operations** - Business-critical, untested at scale
2. **Resilience Framework** - New feature, zero benchmarks
3. **MCP Server** - Core AI feature, unvalidated for performance

**Estimated effort to close all gaps: 50-60 hours (3-5 days with 2-3 engineers)**

**Risk Level if Not Fixed: HIGH** - These are production-critical operations running untested under load

**Recommendation: Implement Critical Priority tests before deploying to production.**
