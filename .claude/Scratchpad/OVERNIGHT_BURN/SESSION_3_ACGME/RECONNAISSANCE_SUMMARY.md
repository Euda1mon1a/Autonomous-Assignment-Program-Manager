***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** INVESTIGATION - Fatigue Mitigation Strategies Found

**Real-Time Interventions:**
- Duty restrictions (shift swaps, early release, schedule modification)
- Buddy system pairing with senior colleagues
- Mandatory rest periods
- Shift duration limits (enforce hard caps)
- Recovery time between shifts (10-hour minimum)

**Short-Term Interventions:**
- Workload reduction (15-50% depending on risk level)
- Weekly/daily fatigue monitoring
- Peer support group participation
- Individual counseling (weekly to daily)
- Sleep medicine consultation

**Long-Term Interventions:**
- Schedule redesign (rotating heavy/light assignments)
- Extended leave options (sick, medical, FMLA)
- Phased return-to-work protocols
- Personal model calibration (resilience assessment)
- Rotation sequence optimization

**Program-Level Interventions:**
- Rotation template design (balance intensity)
- Fair distribution of call nights
- Protected time off enforcement
- Faculty wellness modeling
- Culture change (destigmatize treatment)

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** ARCANA - ACGME Wellness Requirements Documented

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** INSIGHT - Burnout Prevention Philosophy

**System Design Demonstrates:**
1. **Prevention Over Reaction** - Predict 4-12 weeks early, intervene proactively
2. **Scientific Rigor** - Cross-disciplinary models (not subjective judgment)
3. **Objective Measurement** - Validated scales (Samn-Perelli, MBI, PHQ-9, GAD-7)
4. **Privacy & Dignity** - Encrypted data, person knows status, confidential resources
5. **Sustainable Pace** - 80-hour rule as minimum fairness floor, not ceiling
6. **Contagion Awareness** - Burned-out person affects entire team
7. **Resident Rights** - Explicit protections against retaliation, confidential access to resources
8. **Continuous Learning** - Calibrate models from actual burnout events for improvement

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** RELIGION - Is Wellness Tracked Systemically?

**YES - Comprehensive System Integration:**

1. **Database Models:**
   - `fatigue_assessments` (Samn-Perelli scores)
   - `fatigue_hazard_alerts` (risk levels)
   - `fatigue_interventions` (actions taken + outcomes)
   - `workload_history` (daily block intensity)
   - `burnout_predictions` (model outputs)
   - `symptom_records` (MBI/PHQ9/GAD7)
   - `burnout_events` (calibration data)
   - `personal_calibration` (person-specific parameters)

2. **Scheduling Constraints:**
   - Hard constraints (prevent invalid schedules)
   - Soft constraints (prefer better outcomes)
   - `BurnoutProtectionConstraint` (avoid overloading high-risk residents)

3. **Monitoring & Reporting:**
   - Real-time dashboard (program director view)
   - Weekly compliance reports
   - Monthly risk assessments
   - Annual burnout prevalence audits
   - Post-event review and learning

4. **Alert Routing:**
   - CRITICAL predictions → PD + Occupational Health + Psychiatry
   - HIGH predictions → PD + Occupational Health
   - Hazard alerts → Shift supervisor + program coordinator

5. **Measurement & Metrics:**
   - Miner's cumulative damage (0.0-1.0+ scale)
   - Burnout prediction days (ensemble output)
   - Confidence intervals (uncertainty quantification)
   - Risk levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW)
   - Primary failure modes (S-N, Miner, Larson-Miller, Paris)

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** NATURE - Is Wellness Performative or Real?

**REAL - NOT PERFORMATIVE:**

**Evidence of Genuine Implementation:**
1. **Hard Constraints** - Violations prevented at scheduling layer, not just monitored
2. **Automation** - No manual workarounds; system enforces rules
3. **Prediction** - 4-12 week advance warning (allows prevention, not crisis response)
4. **Multi-Intervention** - Not one-size-fits-all; graduated response based on severity
5. **Resource Commitment** - EAP, occupational health, psychiatry, peer support budgeted
6. **Privacy Protection** - Burnout data encrypted, not accessible to general admin
7. **Calibration Loop** - Models improve from actual burnout events (learning system)
8. **Resident Rights** - Documented protections against retaliation
9. **Leave Options** - Medical leave available without career penalty
10. **Escalation Protocols** - Emergency protocols for BLACK status (psychiatric eval within 24h)

**Not Performative Because:**
- Wellness is enforced BEFORE crisis (prevention)
- System prevents someone from being scheduled into burnout (not rescue afterward)
- Interventions are graduated (not binary on/off)
- Person's risk status is transparent (they can see predictions)
- Recovery supported (phased return, modified duties)
- Program learns from failures (model calibration)

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** SURVIVAL - Crisis Intervention Protocols

**Escalation Pathway:**

| Status | Fatigue Level | Miner Damage | Days to Burnout | Protocol |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| **GREEN** | ≤ 3 | < 0.5 | > 180 | Monitoring + education |
| **YELLOW** | 4 | 0.5-0.7 | 90-180 | 15-20% workload reduction + weekly check-ins |
| **ORANGE** | 5 | 0.7-0.9 | 30-90 | 25-30% reduction + weekly counseling |
| **RED** | 6 | > 0.9 | < 30 | 50% reduction/medical leave + daily monitoring |
| **BLACK** | 7 | ≥ 1.0 + acute symptoms | ≤ 7 | Emergency protocols + same-day psychiatry |

**BLACK Status Triggers:**
- Immediate medical leave activation
- Emergency psychiatric evaluation (same day)
- Crisis intervention team (if safety concerns)
- Hospitalization consideration (if suicidal ideation)
- Family and support system activation
- No clinical duties until cleared by psychiatry

**Recovery Support:**
- Phased return-to-work (50% → 75% → 100%)
- Modified duty assignments (avoid previously problematic rotations)
- Buddy system pairing
- Weekly check-ins with program director

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** STEALTH - Hidden Burnout Indicators Detected

**System Detects Multiple Precursor Signals:**

1. **Fatigue Signal Precursors:**
   - Trending fatigue scores (direction matters)
   - Increasing Samn-Perelli levels week-to-week
   - Sleep debt accumulation
   - Circadian disruption (night float clustering)

2. **Workload Anomalies (SPC Rules):**
   - Sudden spikes (Rule 1: 3σ from mean)
   - Sustained elevation (Rule 2: 9 consecutive high weeks)
   - Upward trends (Rule 3: 6 consecutive increasing weeks)
   - Oscillating high values (Rule 4: 2-3 consecutive >2σ)

3. **Symptom Progression (Paris Law):**
   - MBI Emotional Exhaustion trending upward
   - PHQ-9 depression scores increasing
   - GAD-7 anxiety scores increasing
   - Single-item burnout scale deterioration

4. **Contagion Spread (Epidemiology):**
   - Multiple residents in same rotation burning out simultaneously
   - Burnout after one person departs (redistribution of work)
   - Demoralization spreading through team

5. **Damage Accumulation (Miner's Rule):**
   - High-intensity cycles clustering
   - Insufficient recovery time between heavy rotations
   - No low-intensity weeks for healing

6. **Creep Damage (Larson-Miller):**
   - Sustained 70+ hour weeks (not acute spikes, but chronic)
   - Persistent moderate-high workload over 8+ weeks
   - No planned restoration weeks
