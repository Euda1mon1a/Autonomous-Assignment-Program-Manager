***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Mission Summary

Create comprehensive documentation for model tier (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) selection when executing AI agent skills. Provide a deterministic, algorithmic approach to tier selection with clear examples, cost analysis, and implementation guidelines.

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** SEARCH_PARTY Lenses Applied

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1. PERCEPTION: Current Tier Usage
**Finding:** 94% of skills currently assigned to Opus, only 6% to Haiku, 0% to Sonnet
- Indicates over-reliance on most expensive model
- Missed cost optimization opportunity
- No tier differentiation strategy

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2. INVESTIGATION: Task-to-Tier Mapping
**Finding:** Clear mapping exists from task domains/dependencies to optimal tier
- Linting/routing → Haiku (fast, cheap)
- Standard development → Sonnet (balanced)
- Security/complex reasoning → Opus (powerful)
- Current assignments don't follow this pattern

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3. ARCANA: Model Capability Differences
**Finding:** Each tier has distinct capabilities and cost profiles
- Haiku: Fast (500ms), cheap (1x), limited reasoning
- Sonnet: Balanced (2-3s), moderate (4-5x), good reasoning
- Opus: Slow (5-10s), expensive (10-12x), excellent reasoning
- One-size-fits-all Opus approach wastes resources

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 4. HISTORY: Tier Selection Evolution
**Finding:** Complexity scoring formula exists but not applied systematically
- Formula documented in Session 025 artifacts
- Formula: `(Domains × 3) + (Dependencies × 2) + (Time × 2) + (Risk × 1) + (Knowledge × 1)`
- Tiers: 0-5→Haiku, 6-12→Sonnet, 13+→Opus
- Never operationalized as systematic tier assignment

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 5. INSIGHT: Cost vs Capability Philosophy
**Finding:** Three viable philosophies with different trade-offs
- Cost-First: 70% savings, lower quality
- Balanced (recommended): 50-60% savings, optimized quality
- Quality-First: 0% savings, excellent quality
- Balanced approach balances budget and quality constraints

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 6. RELIGION: Automated Tier Selection
**Finding:** Tier selection can and should be automated
- Rule-based constraints (security, compliance → Opus)
- Complexity score determinism
- Hard boundaries (Haiku can't do security, Opus wastes on linting)
- Soft boundaries (some tasks work on 2+ tiers)

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 7. NATURE: Tier Boundaries
**Finding:** Clear hard boundaries exist, soft boundaries task-dependent
- Haiku: Cannot handle multi-step reasoning or security analysis
- Sonnet: Cannot handle security audits or novel algorithm design
- Opus: Wasteful for linting, formatting, simple routing
- Overlap zones where context matters

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 8. MEDICINE: Task Complexity Context
**Finding:** ACGME/compliance tasks need higher tiers than general development
- ACGME rule explanation → Haiku
- Schedule validation → Sonnet
- Full compliance audit → Opus
- Context and scope determine tier more than task type

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 9. SURVIVAL: Fallback Tier Handling
**Finding:** Predictable escalation chain prevents failures
- Haiku → Sonnet → Opus (upgrade when task too complex)
- Haiku successes can be reused, reducing cost
- Robust error detection enables smart escalation
- Human escalation only when even Opus struggles

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 10. STEALTH: Misaligned Tier Detection
**Finding:** Misalignment patterns are detectable and actionable
- Under-provisioned: Vague output, incomplete reasoning
- Over-provisioned: Overcomplicated solutions, unnecessary documentation
- Automated detection possible using complexity scoring
- Monthly audits can maintain alignment

***REMOVED******REMOVED*** Key Findings

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 1. Complexity Scoring Formula
```
Score = (Domains × 3) + (Dependencies × 2) + (Time × 2) + (Risk × 1) + (Knowledge × 1)

0-5   → Haiku (Scout)
6-12  → Sonnet (Strategist)
13+   → Opus (Architect)
```

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 2. Current vs Optimal Tier Distribution

**Current:**
- Haiku: 6% (2 skills)
- Sonnet: 0% (0 skills)
- Opus: 94% (32 skills)

**Recommended:**
- Haiku: 30% (10 skills) - Linting, routing, reference
- Sonnet: 55% (18 skills) - Standard development
- Opus: 15% (5 skills) - Complex reasoning, security

***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** 3. Cost Savings Potential
- Current approach: All Opus = 100% cost baseline
- Recommended approach: Mixed tiers = 40-50% cost
- Savings: **50-60% reduction** in model operational costs
