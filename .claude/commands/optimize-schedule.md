<!--
Multi-objective schedule optimization using constraint programming.
Use when improving coverage or balancing workloads.
-->

Invoke the schedule-optimization skill for optimization.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optimization goal (e.g., "maximize coverage", "balance workload", "minimize violations")

## Optimization Targets

1. Coverage rate (target > 80%)
2. Workload fairness (Gini coefficient)
3. ACGME compliance (0 violations)
4. Call distribution equity
5. Preference satisfaction

## Output

Before/after comparison with metrics.
