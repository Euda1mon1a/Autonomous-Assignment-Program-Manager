## Seasonal Patterns

### Deployment Season (Jun-Aug)

**Characteristics:**
- **Health Score Impact:** -0.10 to -0.15 (avg: -0.12)
- **Primary Driver:** Coverage component drops due to TDY/deployment absences
- **Secondary Driver:** Margin component drops (remaining residents absorb workload)

**Historical Data:**

| Year | Jun Health | Jul Health | Aug Health | Avg Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2022-2023 | 0.64 | 0.60 | 0.67 | -0.13 |
| 2023-2024 | 0.66 | 0.61 | 0.68 | -0.12 |
| 2024-2025 | 0.65 | 0.62 | 0.68 | -0.12 |

**Mitigation Effectiveness:**
- **Supplemental staff (2023):** Reduced impact from -0.15 → -0.12
- **Cross-training program (2024):** Reduced impact from -0.12 → -0.11 (projected)

### Flu Season (Nov-Feb)

**Characteristics:**
- **Health Score Impact:** -0.05 to -0.10 (avg: -0.07)
- **Primary Driver:** Increased absence rate (illness)
- **Peak Month:** December (holiday leave + flu)

**Historical Data:**

| Year | Nov Health | Dec Health | Jan Health | Feb Health | Avg Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2022-2023 | 0.70 | 0.65 | 0.68 | 0.71 | -0.08 |
| 2023-2024 | 0.71 | 0.67 | 0.69 | 0.72 | -0.07 |
| 2024-2025 | 0.71 | 0.68 | 0.70 | 0.72 | -0.07 |

**Mitigation Effectiveness:**
- **Flu shot campaign (2023):** Reduced absence rate by 15%
- **Backup resident pool (2024):** Maintained coverage despite absences

### Academic Year Start (Jul)

**Characteristics:**
- **Health Score Impact:** -0.15 to -0.20 (most significant dip)
- **Primary Driver:** PGY-1 onboarding (less experienced, slower, higher supervision ratio)
- **Duration:** 4-6 weeks (Jul-Aug)

**Historical Data:**

| Year | Jul Health | Impact vs Jun | Recovery Time (weeks) |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 2022-2023 | 0.58 | -0.08 | 6 |
| 2023-2024 | 0.60 | -0.07 | 5 |
| 2024-2025 | 0.62 | -0.03 | 4 |

**Improvement Trend:** Earlier onboarding and structured orientation (2024) reduced impact and recovery time.

- **PGY2-05 (OB/GYN):** Diversified call assignments to include PGY2-08 (Jan 2025)
- **PGY3-04 (Procedures):** Structured skills transfer to PGY2-03 and PGY2-06 (Mar 2025)

**Effectiveness:**
- PGY2-03 dropped from critical in Apr 2025 (after cross-training completed)
- Critical count reduced from 4 (Jul 2024) → 1 (Apr 2025)

## Incident Correlation

### Schedule Changes Correlated with Health Score Drops

| Date | Schedule Change | Health Before | Health After | Delta | Incident |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------|----------|
| Jul 1, 2024 | New PGY-1 cohort | 0.76 | 0.62 | -0.14 | Expected (onboarding) |
| Nov 10, 2024 | Reduced EM night min_residents 3→2 | 0.76 | 0.71 | -0.05 | Increased fragility |
| Jan 15, 2025 | Added supplemental OB/GYN faculty | 0.68 | 0.70 | +0.02 | Improved resilience |
| Feb 1, 2025 | Increased EM night min_residents 2→3 | 0.70 | 0.72 | +0.02 | Improved resilience |
| Apr 1, 2025 | Cross-training program completion | 0.75 | 0.76 | +0.01 | Modest improvement |

**Key Lessons:**
- **Reducing minimum staffing** (Nov 2024) decreased resilience (as expected)
- **Adding supplemental staff** (Jan 2025) improved resilience (as expected)
- **Increasing minimum staffing** (Feb 2025) improved resilience (as expected)
- **Cross-training** (Apr 2025) had modest health score impact but significant N-1 impact (critical count dropped)

## Improvement Tracking

### Initiative: Cross-Training Program (Sep 2024 - Apr 2025)

**Goal:** Reduce critical resident count from 4 → 2

**Actions:**
1. Identified critical residents and their rotations (Sep 2024)
2. Matched backup residents with compatible availability (Oct 2024)
3. 2-week shadowing rotation for backups (Nov 2024 - Jan 2025)
4. Competency assessment (Feb 2025)
5. Backup residents added to rotation pool (Mar 2025)

**Results:**

**Status:** SUCCESS - Exceeded goal (reduced to 1 instead of target 2)

### Initiative: Supplemental Staff Pool (Nov 2024 - Ongoing)

**Goal:** Reduce collapse probability from 11% → <10%

**Actions:**
1. Pre-credentialed 3 supplemental physicians (Nov 2024)
2. Established on-call rotation for supplemental staff (Dec 2024)
3. Reduced credentialing delay from 24h → 4h (Jan 2025)

**Results:**

| Metric | Before (Nov 2024) | After (Feb 2025) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Collapse Probability | 11.0% | 9.2% | -16% |
| Recovery Time (supplemental) | 42 hours | 28 hours | -33% |
| Actual Incidents Resolved | 1/2 (50%) | 2/2 (100%) | +100% |

**Cost:** $1,500/month (retainer for pre-credentialed pool)

**Status:** SUCCESS - Achieved goal (<10% collapse probability)

### Initiative: Rotation Staffing Adjustment (Feb 2025)

**Goal:** Reduce EM Night failure rate from 78% → <50%

**Actions:**

## Benchmarking Against Other Programs

### National Averages (ACGME Survey 2024)

| Metric | Our Program | National Avg | Percentile |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Health Score | 0.71 | 0.68 | 65th |
| Coverage Component | 0.77 | 0.74 | 62nd |
| Margin Component | 0.26 | 0.28 | 45th (below avg) |
| Continuity Component | 0.81 | 0.79 | 58th |
| Critical Resident Count | 2.4 | 3.1 | 72nd (better) |
| Collapse Probability | 10.9% | 13.2% | 68th (better) |

**Strengths:**
- Better than average on critical resident count (fewer single points of failure)
- Better than average on collapse probability (more resilient)

**Weaknesses:**
- Below average on margin component (residents working more hours)

**Action Plan:**
- Reduce baseline utilization to improve margin component (target: 60-70 hours/week max)

## Predictive Analytics (Experimental)

### Machine Learning Model: Health Score Prediction

**Goal:** Predict next month's health score based on historical trends and upcoming events.

**Model:** Linear regression with seasonal adjustment

**Features:**
- Previous 3 months' health scores
- Scheduled leave (count)
- Deployment season flag (Jun-Aug)
- Flu season flag (Nov-Feb)
- Academic year start flag (Jul)

**Accuracy (2024-2025):**
- **Mean Absolute Error:** 0.04 (±0.04 health score prediction)
- **R² Score:** 0.78 (explains 78% of variance)

**Example Prediction:**

| Month | Predicted Health | Actual Health | Error | Within ±0.05? |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| Jan 2025 | 0.68 | 0.70 | -0.02 | ✅ Yes |
| Feb 2025 | 0.71 | 0.72 | -0.01 | ✅ Yes |
| Mar 2025 | 0.74 | 0.75 | -0.01 | ✅ Yes |
| Apr 2025 | 0.77 | 0.76 | +0.01 | ✅ Yes |
| May 2025 | 0.75 | 0.74 | +0.01 | ✅ Yes |
| Jun 2025 | 0.66 | 0.65 | +0.01 | ✅ Yes |

**Status:** Model is accurate and useful for proactive planning.

## Future Data Collection

### Planned Metrics (2025-2026)

To further improve resilience analysis, we plan to track:

1. **Burnout correlation:** SPC charts + health score correlation
2. **Patient outcomes:** Correlation between schedule health and patient safety metrics
3. **Resident satisfaction:** Quarterly surveys correlated with continuity component
4. **Cost-benefit analysis:** Track mitigation costs vs avoided incidents

### Data Gaps

Currently missing data on:
- **Actual absence rates** (we estimate, but don't track precisely)
- **Supplemental staff effectiveness** (satisfaction scores, quality metrics)
- **Cross-training retention** (do cross-trained residents stay competent over time?)

**Action Plan:** Implement tracking for these metrics starting Jul 2025.

---

## Summary

**Historical Performance:**
- **Overall Trend:** Improving (health score 0.62 → 0.76 over 10 months)
- **Most Effective Mitigation:** Cross-training program (reduced critical count by 75%)
- **Most Costly Issue:** EM Night fragility (still 57% failure rate despite interventions)
- **Most Resilient Period:** Apr-May (spring stability)
- **Most Vulnerable Period:** Jul-Aug (deployment season + academic year start)

**Recommended Actions for 2025-2026:**
1. Continue cross-training program (maintain backup pools)
2. Further address EM Night fragility (consider min_residents 3→4)
3. Reduce baseline utilization (target margin component ≥ 0.30)
4. Maintain pre-credentialed supplemental staff pool
5. Implement predictive model for proactive planning
