# ACGME Compliance Rules Reference

Detailed reference for ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) work hour and training requirements for medical residency programs.

---

## Overview

ACGME compliance is **non-negotiable**. All schedules must achieve 100% compliance with these rules before deployment. These are regulatory requirements that protect resident health, safety, and educational quality.

**Last Updated:** December 2025
**Source:** ACGME Common Program Requirements (Section VI)
**Authority:** Federal regulation, program accreditation dependent on compliance

## Core ACGME Rules

### 1. 80-Hour Work Week Rule

#### Rule Statement

**Maximum 80 hours per week**, averaged over a rolling 4-week period.

#### Detailed Requirements

**Calculation Method:**
```
Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 + Week 4
--------------------------------- ≤ 80 hours
              4
```

**Rolling Window:**
- Calculate for EVERY possible 4-week window
- Not just block boundaries
- Example: Week 3-6, Week 4-7, Week 5-8, etc.

**What Counts as Work:**
- All clinical duties
- Required educational activities (conferences, didactics)
- Administrative duties related to patient care
- On-call time (both in-house and remote)

**What Does NOT Count:**
- Voluntary study time
- Optional conferences
- Research time (unless clinically integrated)
- Commute time

#### Warning Thresholds

| Status | Hours/Week (4-week avg) | Action Required |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **GREEN** | ≤ 70 | None, optimal |
| **YELLOW** | 71-75 | Monitor closely |
| **ORANGE** | 76-79 | Immediate review, prevent further increase |
| **RED** | 80 | At limit, cannot add more |
| **VIOLATION** | > 80 | CRITICAL - must fix before deployment |

#### Common Violations and Fixes

**Violation:** Back-to-back high-intensity rotations
```
Week 1: Inpatient (75 hours)
Week 2: EM rotation (78 hours)
Week 3: Call week (82 hours)  ← VIOLATION
Week 4: Clinic (40 hours)
Average: 68.75 (compliant)

But week 1-2-3 average during high period:
(75 + 78 + 82 + 40) / 4 = 68.75 ✓

However, check window Week 0-1-2-3:
(70 + 75 + 78 + 82) / 4 = 76.25 ✓

And Week 1-2-3-4:
(75 + 78 + 82 + 40) / 4 = 68.75 ✓

Actually check EVERY window - if Week 0 was also 75:
(75 + 75 + 78 + 82) / 4 = 77.5 (WARNING)
```

**Fix:** Stagger high-intensity rotations with lower-hour rotations

**Violation:** Holiday coverage stacking
```
Resident covers Thanksgiving (80 hours) + Christmas (85 hours) within 4-week span
```

**Fix:** Distribute holiday coverage across different residents or ensure buffer weeks

#### Exceptions

**No exceptions allowed.** 80 hours is an absolute maximum.

Note: Some specialties (surgery, neurosurgery) historically had 88-hour limits, but as of 2011 all programs are limited to 80 hours.

### 2. One Day Off in Seven (1-in-7 Rule)

#### Rule Statement

**One 24-hour period free from duty every 7 days**, averaged over 4 weeks.

#### Detailed Requirements

**Definition of "Day Off":**
- Minimum 24 consecutive hours
- No clinical duties
- No required educational activities
- No pager/phone duty
- Complete freedom from work

**Calculation:**
```
Days off in 4 weeks ≥ 4 (one per week on average)

Example acceptable patterns:
- Sunday off every week (4 days off in 4 weeks) ✓
- Saturday off Week 1, Sunday off Week 2, Friday off Week 3, Saturday off Week 4 (4 days) ✓
- Two days off Week 1, zero Week 2, one Week 3, two Week 4 (5 days total) ✓

Example violations:
- One day off Week 1, none Week 2-4 (1 day in 4 weeks) ✗
- Working 12 consecutive days (even if you'll get 3 days off later) ✗
```

**In-House Call Consideration:**
- 24-hour call shift does NOT count as a day off
- Post-call day (after 24-hour shift) CAN count as day off if:
  - No clinical duties for 24 hours
  - Strategic napping allowed during call does not reduce day off requirement

#### Warning Thresholds

| Status | Pattern | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **GREEN** | 5+ days off per 4 weeks | Optimal |
| **YELLOW** | 4 days off per 4 weeks | At limit |
| **ORANGE** | 6+ consecutive duty days | High risk |
| **VIOLATION** | <4 days off per 4 weeks | CRITICAL |

#### Common Violations and Fixes

**Violation:** Night Float week
```
Night Float rotation (7 consecutive nights)
- No days off during the week
- Plan: Make up with days off before/after

Issue: Still violates "one in seven" if 7+ consecutive duty days
```

**Fix:** Build mandatory day off mid-rotation or ensure <7 consecutive days

**Violation:** Conference + Call + Clinic
```
Monday-Friday: Conference/Clinic
Saturday: Call
Sunday: Post-call rounds until noon, then "off"

Issue: Sunday is NOT a full 24-hour day off (had to round)
```

**Fix:** Ensure post-call day is truly free from hour 0-24

#### Exceptions

**Rare exceptions allowed with documentation:**
- Critical patient care continuity
- Must be approved by Program Director
- Must be documented with rationale
- Cannot be a pattern

---

### 3. Duty Period Limits

#### Rule Statement

**Maximum duty period: 24 hours** (plus up to 4 hours for transitions)

#### Detailed Requirements

**Duty Period Definition:**
- Starts when resident begins clinical work
- Ends when resident is completely relieved of duties
- Includes all patient care and educational activities

**Standard Duty Period:**
- Maximum: 24 consecutive hours

**Extended Duty Period (24 + 4):**
- Maximum: 24 hours + 4 hours transition
- Transition time (4 hours) must be for:
  - Patient handoffs
  - Educational activities
  - Transfer of care
- NO new patients during transition time
- NO operating room cases during transition time

**Post-Duty Rest:**
- Minimum 8 hours off between duty periods (14 hours preferred)
- If call was >24 hours, minimum 14 hours off required

#### Shift Types and Limits

| Shift Type | Maximum Hours | Minimum Rest After |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Day shift | 12-14 | 8 hours |
| Night shift | 12-14 | 8 hours |
| In-house call | 24 (+4 transition) | 14 hours |
| Home call | Varies | 8 hours (if called in) |

#### Common Violations and Fixes

**Violation:** Post-call clinic
```
7 AM: Start inpatient shift
7 AM next day: Sign out (24 hours)
11 AM: Transition activities end (28 hours total)
1 PM: Start afternoon clinic ← VIOLATION (only 2 hours rest)
```

**Fix:** No assignments for at least 14 hours after 24-hour call

**Violation:** Back-to-back shifts
```
7 AM - 7 PM: Day shift (12 hours)
11 PM - 7 AM: Night shift ← VIOLATION (only 4 hours rest)
```

**Fix:** Minimum 8 hours between shifts

### 4. Supervision Requirements

#### Rule Statement

**Adequate supervision must be provided**, with ratios based on training level.

#### Supervision Ratios

| Training Level | Maximum Residents per Faculty | Direct vs. Indirect |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **PGY-1** | 2:1 | Direct supervision required |
| **PGY-2** | 4:1 | Indirect with direct available |
| **PGY-3** | 4:1 | Indirect with direct available |
| **PGY-4+** | 6:1 | Indirect supervision acceptable |

**Direct Supervision:**
- Attending physician is physically present
- Provides immediate availability
- Observes and guides procedures

**Indirect Supervision with Direct Availability:**
- Attending is not physically present
- Immediately available by phone
- Can be on-site within reasonable time (<30 minutes)

**Indirect Supervision:**
- Attending is available by phone
- Supervises remotely
- Reviews and co-signs notes

#### Application by Setting

**Inpatient Wards (FMIT, IM):**
- PGY-1: Max 2 per 1 faculty
- PGY-2/3: Max 4 per 1 faculty
- Faculty must be on-site or immediately available

**Emergency Department:**
- PGY-1: Direct supervision required (1:1 or 2:1)
- PGY-2/3: Indirect with direct available (4:1)

**Clinic:**
- PGY-1: Direct supervision initially, may progress to indirect
- PGY-2/3: Indirect with direct available
- Faculty on-site or immediately accessible

**Night Float:**
- PGY-2/3 only (no solo PGY-1 night float)
- Attending available by phone
- Senior resident supervision acceptable for PGY-1 if present

#### Common Violations and Fixes

**Violation:** Insufficient faculty for PGY-1s
```
8 PGY-1 residents on inpatient wards
2 faculty scheduled ← VIOLATION (4:1 ratio, should be 2:1)
```

**Fix:** Schedule 4 faculty for 8 PGY-1s

**Violation:** Solo PGY-1 on night float
```
PGY-1 assigned to solo overnight coverage ← VIOLATION
```

**Fix:** Night float requires PGY-2/3 level or direct faculty supervision

**Violation:** Immediate return to day schedule
```
Friday night: Last night float shift (ends 7 AM Saturday)
Saturday 1 PM: Clinic shift ← VIOLATION (insufficient recovery)
```

**Fix:** Minimum 24 hours off, 48-72 hours preferred

---

### 6. On-Call Frequency

### Validation Methods

#### Automated Validation (Recommended)

```bash
# Run comprehensive ACGME check
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/schedule/validate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"schedule_id": "2026-2027", "strict": true}' \
  | jq '.acgme_violations'
```

**Expected output if compliant:**
```json
{
  "acgme_compliant": true,
  "violations": [],
  "warnings": [
    "PGY2-04 at 76 hours in week ending 2026-03-15 (WARNING threshold)"
  ]
}
```

#### Manual Validation

**80-Hour Check:**
```sql
-- Find any 4-week period with >80 hours average
WITH weekly_hours AS (
  SELECT
    person_id,
    date_trunc('week', date) AS week_start,
    SUM(hours) AS total_hours
  FROM assignments
  GROUP BY person_id, week_start
)
SELECT
  person_id,
  w1.week_start,
  (w1.total_hours + w2.total_hours + w3.total_hours + w4.total_hours) / 4.0 AS avg_hours
FROM weekly_hours w1
JOIN weekly_hours w2 ON w1.person_id = w2.person_id AND w2.week_start = w1.week_start + INTERVAL '1 week'
JOIN weekly_hours w3 ON w1.person_id = w3.person_id AND w3.week_start = w1.week_start + INTERVAL '2 weeks'
JOIN weekly_hours w4 ON w1.person_id = w4.person_id AND w4.week_start = w1.week_start + INTERVAL '3 weeks'
WHERE (w1.total_hours + w2.total_hours + w3.total_hours + w4.total_hours) / 4.0 > 80;
```

**1-in-7 Check:**
```sql
-- Find any 7-day period without a full day off
WITH days_off AS (
  SELECT person_id, date
  FROM generate_series('2026-07-01'::date, '2027-06-30'::date, '1 day') AS date
  LEFT JOIN assignments USING (person_id, date)
  WHERE assignments.id IS NULL  -- No assignment = day off
)
SELECT person_id, COUNT(*) AS days_off_total
FROM days_off
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(*) < 52;  -- Less than 1 per week on average
```

**Supervision Ratio Check:**
```sql
-- Check supervision ratios by block and rotation
WITH resident_counts AS (
  SELECT
    block_id,
    rotation_id,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pgy_level = 1) AS pgy1_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE pgy_level >= 2) AS pgy23_count
  FROM assignments
  JOIN people ON assignments.person_id = people.id
  WHERE people.role = 'RESIDENT'
  GROUP BY block_id, rotation_id
),
faculty_counts AS (
  SELECT
    block_id,
    rotation_id,
    COUNT(*) AS faculty_count
  FROM assignments
  JOIN people ON assignments.person_id = people.id
  WHERE people.role = 'FACULTY'
  GROUP BY block_id, rotation_id
)
SELECT
  r.block_id,
  r.rotation_id,
  r.pgy1_count,
  r.pgy23_count,
  f.faculty_count,
  CASE
    WHEN r.pgy1_count > 2 * f.faculty_count THEN 'VIOLATION: PGY-1 ratio'
    WHEN r.pgy23_count > 4 * f.faculty_count THEN 'VIOLATION: PGY-2/3 ratio'
    ELSE 'COMPLIANT'
  END AS status
FROM resident_counts r
JOIN faculty_counts f USING (block_id, rotation_id)
WHERE r.pgy1_count > 2 * f.faculty_count
   OR r.pgy23_count > 4 * f.faculty_count;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can residents volunteer to work >80 hours?

**A:** No. The 80-hour limit is absolute. Even if a resident requests additional hours, it violates ACGME rules.

### Q: Does conference time count toward 80 hours?

**A:** Yes, if it's required educational activity. Optional conferences do not count.

### Q: Can we average over a month instead of rolling 4 weeks?

**A:** No. ACGME requires rolling 4-week periods, not calendar months.

### Q: What if a resident stays late to finish notes?

**A:** All time spent on work duties counts. If notes are required, the time counts. Programs should ensure residents can complete work within duty hours.

### Q: Can PGY-3s supervise PGY-1s to meet ratios?

**A:** For some activities, yes. Senior residents can provide supervision in appropriate settings. However, faculty availability is still required per ACGME.

### Q: What if we have an emergency and need someone to stay?

**A:** Patient safety takes precedence. Document the exception, ensure appropriate supervision, and adjust future schedule to prevent recurrence. Report if pattern emerges.
