# Compliance Glossary

Comprehensive terminology and definitions for ACGME compliance, medical scheduling, and institutional policies.

---

## ACGME Terms

### ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education)
The organization responsible for accrediting residency and fellowship programs in the United States. Sets standards for duty hours, supervision, and educational requirements.

**Website:** https://www.acgme.org

---

### Common Program Requirements (CPR)
The baseline standards that apply to ALL residency programs, regardless of specialty. Includes duty hour limits, supervision requirements, and educational standards.

**Latest Version:** CPR 2022 (Effective July 1, 2022)

---

### Duty Hours
All clinical and educational activities related to the residency program. Includes:
- In-house patient care
- Clinic time
- Educational conferences
- Grand rounds
- Simulation
- Chart reviews from home
- Telemedicine
- Moonlighting (both internal and external)

**Excludes:**
- Personal study/reading time
- Voluntary educational activities outside program requirements

---

### Rolling 4-Week Average
The method for calculating compliance with the 80-hour rule. Checks EVERY possible 28-day consecutive period, not just calendar months.

**Example:**
- Week 1: 75 hours
- Week 2: 82 hours ❌ (exceeds 80)
- Week 3: 78 hours
- Week 4: 70 hours
- **4-week average:** (75+82+78+70)/4 = 76.25 hours ✅ COMPLIANT

**Critical:** Must check ALL 28-day windows, including:
- Days 1-28
- Days 2-29
- Days 3-30
- ... and so on

---

### 24+4 Rule
Maximum continuous duty period for PGY-2+ residents:
- **First 24 hours:** Active patient care
- **Additional 4 hours:** Handoff and transition activities ONLY
- **Total maximum:** 28 hours

**Key Points:**
- No new patients during the +4 hours
- Must be for patient safety (handoff, sign-out)
- Strategic napping encouraged during night hours
- Not applicable to PGY-1 (interns limited to 16 hours)

---

### 1-in-7 Rule
Residents must have at least one 24-hour period free from ALL clinical, educational, and administrative activities every 7 days, averaged over 4 weeks.

**Simplified Implementation:**
"Residents cannot work more than 6 consecutive calendar days"

**Compliant Patterns (28 days):**
- 1 day off per week (4 total) ✅
- 0-2-1-1 pattern (4 total) ✅
- 0-0-0-4 pattern (4 total) ⚠️ Technically compliant but poor practice

---

### Night Float
A rotation consisting of consecutive overnight shifts (typically 7pm-7am or similar).

**ACGME Limit:** Maximum 6 consecutive nights
**Best Practice:** 5 nights/week for 2 weeks (with days off) = 10 total nights

**Not the same as:** Occasional overnight call

---

### In-House Call
Duty period where resident remains in the hospital overnight, available for admissions and emergencies.

**ACGME Limit:** No more frequently than every third night (q3), averaged over 4 weeks
**Example:** 9-10 calls per month maximum

---

### Home Call (At-Home Call)
Duty period where resident is at home but available by phone/pager. May need to come in if called.

**Key Differences:**
- **No frequency limit** (can be every night)
- **Hours only count if called in** to the hospital
- **Still must meet 1-in-7 rule**

---

### Moonlighting
Extra clinical work performed outside regular residency duties.

**Types:**
- **Internal moonlighting:** Extra shifts within the residency institution
- **External moonlighting:** Work at other facilities

**ACGME Rules:**
- Must be approved by Program Director
- ALL hours count toward 80-hour limit
- Cannot interfere with educational objectives

---

### Direct Supervision
Supervising physician is physically present in the room or immediately available.

**Required for:**
- PGY-1 residents (at all times)
- High-risk procedures
- Complex or unstable patients

---

### Indirect Supervision
Supervising physician is available by phone/pager but not physically present.

**Allowed for:**
- PGY-2+ residents (in most situations)
- Routine patient care
- Stable patients

---

### Strategic Napping
Planned short sleep periods during long duty periods to reduce fatigue.

**ACGME Recommendation:**
- Especially after 16 hours of continuous duty
- Between 10pm-8am
- Protected time (not interrupted for non-urgent issues)

---

### PGY Level (Post-Graduate Year)
The year of residency training.

**Levels:**
- **PGY-1:** Intern (first year)
- **PGY-2:** Second year resident
- **PGY-3:** Third year resident (Chief Resident in some programs)
- **PGY-4+:** Senior residents (specialty-dependent)

**Supervision Differences:**
- PGY-1: Requires direct supervision (1:2 faculty ratio)
- PGY-2+: Can have indirect supervision (1:4 faculty ratio)

---

### CLER (Clinical Learning Environment Review)
ACGME site visits to evaluate the clinical learning environment, including duty hours compliance, patient safety, and well-being.

**Frequency:** Periodic (not annual)
**Focus Areas:**
- Patient safety
- Health care quality
- Care transitions
- Supervision
- Duty hours and fatigue management
- Professionalism

---

## Institutional Terms

### FMIT (Faculty Member of Inpatient Team)
**Institutional requirement** (not ACGME-mandated) for weekly faculty rotation on inpatient service.

**Rules:**
- One faculty assigned per week
- Covers Friday/Saturday call during their week
- No back-to-back FMIT weeks for same faculty
- Sunday after FMIT is blocked (recovery)

**Not the same as:** ACGME supervision requirements

---

### Block
The time unit for scheduling. In this system, each day is divided into two blocks:
- **AM block:** Morning session (typically 7am-1pm)
- **PM block:** Afternoon/evening session (typically 1pm-7pm or later)

**Academic Year:** 365 days × 2 blocks/day = 730 blocks

**Block Numbers:** Academic blocks (e.g., "Block 10") spanning 28 days

---

### Rotation
A specific type of clinical or educational assignment.

**Types:**
- **Inpatient:** Hospital-based patient care (FMIT, Night Float, NICU)
- **Clinic:** Outpatient clinic assignments
- **Conference:** Protected educational time
- **Procedure:** Procedure-based rotations
- **Absence:** Leave, vacation, TDY, deployment

---

### Assignment
A specific person assigned to a specific block for a specific rotation.

**Example:**
- **Person:** PGY2-01
- **Block:** 2026-03-15 AM
- **Rotation:** FMIT
- **Result:** "PGY2-01 is on FMIT rotation on the morning of March 15, 2026"

---

### Coverage
The percentage of blocks that have assignments.

**Metrics:**
- **Overall coverage:** All blocks assigned / total blocks
- **Weekday coverage:** Weekday blocks assigned / total weekday blocks
- **Weekend coverage:** Weekend blocks assigned / total weekend blocks

**Targets:**
- Weekday: > 95%
- Weekend: > 50%
- Overall: > 80%

---

### Post-Call
The period immediately following a long duty period (e.g., after overnight call or 24-hour shift).

**Institutional Policy:**
- No clinic assignments immediately post-call
- Preferably full day off or half day only
- Minimum 8-10 hours off before next duty period

---

### TDY (Temporary Duty)
Military term for temporary assignment to another location.

**Impact on scheduling:**
- Resident unavailable for all clinical duties during TDY
- Must be marked as absence in system
- Counts as OPSEC-sensitive data (do not commit to repo)

---

### MTF (Medical Treatment Facility)
Military term for hospital or clinic.

**Examples:**
- Naval Medical Center
- Air Force Medical Center
- Army Medical Center

---

## Constraint Terms

### Constraint
A rule or requirement that must be satisfied (hard constraint) or optimized (soft constraint) during schedule generation.

**Types:**
- **Hard constraint:** Must be satisfied (e.g., ACGME rules, absences)
- **Soft constraint:** Should be satisfied but can be violated with penalty (e.g., call spacing, preferences)

---

### Constraint Tier
Priority classification for constraints:

**Tier 1: ACGME Regulatory (CRITICAL)**
- 80-hour rule
- 1-in-7 rule
- Supervision ratios
- Duty period limits
- Availability (no assignments during absences)
- **Penalty:** Infinite (schedule invalid if violated)

**Tier 2: Institutional Hard Constraints (HIGH)**
- FMIT coverage
- Night Float headcount
- NICU Friday clinic
- Post-call blocking
- **Penalty:** Very high (schedule should not be deployed)

**Tier 3: Soft Constraints (MEDIUM)**
- Call spacing
- Weekend distribution
- Clinic day preferences
- **Penalty:** Medium (deviations allowed but undesirable)

**Tier 4: Optimization Goals (LOW)**
- Workload balance
- Continuity of care
- Learning opportunities
- **Penalty:** Low (nice-to-have improvements)

---

### Violation
An instance where a constraint is not satisfied.

**Severity Levels:**
- **CRITICAL:** Tier 1 violation (ACGME regulatory)
- **HIGH:** Tier 2 violation (institutional hard constraint)
- **MEDIUM:** Tier 3 violation (soft constraint)
- **LOW:** Tier 4 violation (optimization goal)

**Example Violation:**
```python
Violation(
    type="80_HOUR_RULE_VIOLATION",
    severity="CRITICAL",
    person_id="uuid-123",
    person_name="PGY2-01",
    message="PGY2-01: 82.5 hours/week (limit: 80) in window 2026-03-01 to 2026-03-28",
    details={
        "window_start": "2026-03-01",
        "window_end": "2026-03-28",
        "average_weekly_hours": 82.5,
        "max_allowed": 80
    }
)
```

---

### Compliance Rate
The percentage of constraints or blocks that satisfy all requirements.

**Calculation:**
```
Compliance Rate = (compliant_items / total_items) × 100%
```

**Examples:**
- **Constraint compliance:** 32 of 35 constraints passed = 91.4%
- **Block compliance:** 5 of 6 blocks have no violations = 83.3%

**Targets:**
- Monthly: > 95%
- Quarterly: > 98%
- Annual: > 99%

---

### Remediation
The process of fixing identified violations.

**Strategies:**
- **REMOVE_ASSIGNMENT:** Delete conflicting assignment
- **INSERT_DAY_OFF:** Create mandatory rest day
- **REDISTRIBUTE_LOAD:** Swap assignments to balance hours
- **SPLIT_SHIFT:** Break up long duty periods
- **ADD_FACULTY:** Increase supervision
- **MANUAL_REVIEW:** Complex cases requiring human decision

---

### Audit Trail
Historical record of all schedule changes, violations, and remediations.

**Required Data:**
- Who made the change
- When it was made
- What was changed (before/after)
- Why it was changed (violation fix, swap request, etc.)

**Purpose:**
- ACGME compliance documentation
- Troubleshooting
- Process improvement
- Legal protection

---

## Scheduling Algorithm Terms

### CP-SAT (Constraint Programming - Satisfiability)
Google OR-Tools solver used for schedule generation. Finds feasible solutions to constraint satisfaction problems.

**Advantages:**
- Handles complex constraints
- Guaranteed to find solution if exists
- Fast for hard constraints

---

### PuLP (Python Linear Programming)
Alternative solver using linear programming.

**Advantages:**
- Good for optimization problems
- Can handle soft constraints with weighted penalties

---

### Decision Variable
In constraint programming, a variable representing a choice:
```python
x[resident_i, block_j] = 1 if resident i is assigned to block j, else 0
```

---

### Objective Function
The formula to optimize during schedule generation.

**Example:**
```
Minimize: (total_violations × 1000) + (coverage_gap × 100) + (workload_imbalance × 10)
```

**Goal:** Find schedule with lowest objective value

---

### Feasible Solution
A schedule that satisfies ALL hard constraints.

**Not the same as:** Optimal solution (which also optimizes soft constraints)

---

### Infeasible Problem
A scheduling scenario where no solution exists that satisfies all hard constraints.

**Common Causes:**
- Insufficient personnel
- Conflicting hard constraints
- Too many absences
- Over-constrained system

**Resolution:**
- Relax soft constraints
- Add more personnel
- Adjust coverage requirements
- Request constraint exception

---

## Metric Terms

### Utilization
The percentage of available time that a person is assigned to clinical duties.

**Formula:**
```
Utilization = (assigned_blocks / available_blocks) × 100%
```

**Resilience Framework Threshold:** 80% maximum (queuing theory)

**Status Levels:**
- < 80%: GREEN (safe)
- 80-85%: YELLOW (monitor)
- 85-90%: ORANGE (at risk)
- > 90%: RED (critical - cascade failure risk)

---

### N-1 Contingency
A resilience concept from power grid engineering: system must remain stable even if 1 component fails.

**Scheduling Application:**
"Schedule must maintain coverage if any 1 resident is unexpectedly unavailable"

**Check:** Can schedule absorb 1 unplanned absence without violations?

---

### N-2 Contingency
System must remain stable if 2 components fail simultaneously.

**Scheduling Application:**
"Schedule must maintain coverage if any 2 residents are unexpectedly unavailable"

**Higher bar:** Stronger resilience but harder to achieve

---

### Workload Balance
Measure of how evenly work is distributed among personnel.

**Metrics:**
- Standard deviation of hours worked
- Max variance from average
- Gini coefficient (inequality measure)

**Target:** Max variance < 10% of average

---

### Coverage Gap
A block that has no assigned personnel (uncovered).

**Acceptable for:**
- Weekend non-clinic blocks (expected)
- Holiday blocks (may be covered by FMIT default)

**Unacceptable for:**
- Weekday clinic blocks
- Critical inpatient blocks
- Required supervision blocks

---

## Clinical Terms

### Inpatient
Patient care for hospitalized patients (admitted to the hospital).

**Rotations:**
- FMIT (Faculty Member of Inpatient Team)
- Night Float (overnight inpatient coverage)
- NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit)

---

### Outpatient
Patient care for non-hospitalized patients (clinic visits).

**Rotations:**
- Clinic (general outpatient clinic)
- Subspecialty clinic

---

### Grand Rounds
Weekly educational conference where interesting cases are presented and discussed.

**ACGME Status:** Counts as duty hours (educational activity)
**Typically:** 1-2 hours per week

---

### Handoff (Sign-Out)
The process of transferring patient care responsibility from one provider to another.

**ACGME Requirements:**
- Structured format (e.g., I-PASS, SBAR)
- Protected time
- Verification of understanding
- Allowed during +4 hour transition period

---

### Call
Being available for urgent/emergent patient care outside regular hours.

**Types:**
- **In-house call:** Remain in hospital overnight
- **Home call:** At home but available by phone
- **Backup call:** Second-line coverage if primary is overwhelmed

---

### Continuity of Care
Maintaining consistent patient-provider relationships over time.

**Benefits:**
- Better patient outcomes
- Reduced errors
- Improved satisfaction

**Challenge:** Balancing with duty hour limits

---

### Cross-Coverage
Providing care for patients who are not your own (e.g., on call, covering for absent colleague).

**ACGME Status:** Counts as duty hours
**Risk:** Less familiarity with patient history

---

## Military-Specific Terms

### Deployment
Military assignment to a combat zone or overseas location.

**Duration:** Typically 6-12 months
**Impact on residency:** Schedule unavailability, possible training extension

---

### OPSEC (Operational Security)
Protecting sensitive information that could compromise military operations.

**Scheduling context:**
- Do not commit deployment dates to repository
- Do not reveal movement patterns
- Sanitize real names in public demos

---

### PERSEC (Personnel Security)
Protecting personal information about military personnel.

**Scheduling context:**
- Do not commit real names
- Do not commit personal schedules
- Use synthetic identifiers (PGY1-01, FAC-CORE-01)

---

### Chain of Command
Hierarchical structure for military authority.

**Residency context:**
- Program Director → Associate Program Director → Chief Resident → Residents
- Issues escalate up the chain
- Approvals flow down

## Common Questions

### What is the difference between "duty hours" and "work hours"?
**Duty hours** include ALL clinical and educational activities. **Work hours** is a more general term. For ACGME compliance, always use "duty hours."

### Do conferences count toward the 80-hour limit?
**Yes.** All educational activities required by the program count, including grand rounds, didactics, simulation, etc.

### Does studying at home count?
**No.** Personal study/reading time does not count. However, if you are reviewing charts from home for patient care, that DOES count.

### Can a resident volunteer to work extra hours?
**No.** The 80-hour limit applies regardless of whether the resident volunteers. This is a safety requirement, not a preference.

### What happens if we have an unavoidable violation (e.g., mass casualty)?
Document it thoroughly, report it to ACGME as an exception, explain mitigation steps taken. Isolated incidents due to true emergencies are handled differently than systematic violations.

### Can we average duty hours over a month instead of rolling 4 weeks?
**No.** ACGME specifies "rolling four-week period" which means checking EVERY 28-day consecutive window, not calendar months.
