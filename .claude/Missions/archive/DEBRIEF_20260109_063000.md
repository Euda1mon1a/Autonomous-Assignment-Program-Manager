# Mission Debrief: SCHEDULE_RECON_001

**Mission Status:** COMPLETE
**Astronaut:** ASTRONAUT
**Executed At:** 2026-01-09T06:30:00Z
**Duration:** 15 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

Schedule page reconnaissance completed successfully. Authentication works correctly, but the schedule page displays a "Reconnecting" status due to WebSocket connection failures. Schedule grid shows empty data (dashes only) with PGY levels missing numeric values. Admin schedule route (`/admin/schedule`) returns 404.

## Objectives Status

- [x] Successfully authenticate - Login with admin/admin123 succeeded
- [x] View schedule page loads without crash - Page loads but shows connectivity issues
- [x] Document console errors - WebSocket failures and hydration warnings captured
- [x] Note failed network requests - WebSocket at `/api/v1/ws` failing
- [x] Assess overall GUI functionality - Partial functionality, data sync broken

## Findings

### Observation 1: Login Page Functional
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/login
**Evidence:** `screenshots/login_page_1767940238008.png`
**Significance:** Authentication infrastructure is working. Clean UI with "Welcome Back" interface.

### Observation 2: Dashboard Post-Login
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/ (Dashboard)
**Evidence:** `screenshots/post_login_state_1767940278604.png`
**Significance:** Dashboard loads correctly showing:
- "This Week's Schedule" with "No schedule generated" state (expected if no data)
- "Compliance Status: All Clear"
- "Quick Actions" for Generate Schedule and Export Excel
- Navigation bar fully functional

### Observation 3: Schedule Page - Connectivity Issues
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/schedule
**Evidence:** `screenshots/schedule_page_1767940302165.png`
**Significance:** **CRITICAL** - Yellow "Reconnecting" badge visible. Schedule grid shows:
- Residents listed (Alaine Gigon, Cam Mayell, Christian Hernandez, Clara Wilhelm, etc.)
- PGY levels showing "PGY-" with missing numeric values
- Date range Jul 1 - Jun 30, 2026 displayed
- All schedule cells contain dashes (`-`) only
- Block navigation controls present (Previous Block, Next Block, This Block)
- View toggles present (Block, Week, Month, etc.)

### Observation 4: Admin Schedule Route Missing
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/admin/schedule
**Evidence:** `screenshots/admin_schedule_page_1767940358747.png`
**Significance:** Route returns 404 - "This page could not be found." Navigation header still visible but page does not exist.

## Issues Discovered

| Issue                   | Severity | Evidence                             | Recommended Action                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| WebSocket failing       | HIGH     | "Reconnecting" badge, console errors | Check WebSocket server at `/api/v1/ws`                  |
| Schedule data empty     | HIGH     | Dashes in all grid cells             | Verify API data population, check if schedule generated |
| PGY levels incomplete   | MEDIUM   | Shows "PGY-" without numbers         | Check resident data in backend                          |
| /admin/schedule 404     | MEDIUM   | 404 screenshot                       | Route may not be implemented or has different path      |
| React hydration warning | LOW      | Console logs                         | className mismatch on body tag                          |

## Console Errors

```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/api/v1/ws' failed: Connection refused
[Multiple instances]

React hydration warning: Prop `className` did not match on <body> element
```

## Network Anomalies

- **WebSocket failures:** Multiple failed connection attempts to `ws://localhost:3000/api/v1/ws`
- **No other 4xx/5xx errors observed** on standard page loads
- Schedule page appears to rely on WebSocket for real-time data sync

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate WebSocket server** - The `/api/v1/ws` endpoint is not responding. Check if:
   - Backend WebSocket route is configured
   - Backend server is running and WebSocket-enabled
   - Proxy configuration (if any) supports WebSocket upgrades

2. **Verify schedule data** - The empty grid may be because:
   - No schedule has been generated yet
   - Backend API is not returning schedule data
   - WebSocket required for initial data load

3. **Clarify admin schedule route** - Either:
   - Implement `/admin/schedule` route
   - Update mission docs with correct admin path (possibly `/admin/scheduling-lab`)

4. **Fix PGY level display** - Residents show "PGY-" without year numbers, indicating:
   - Data field not populated in database
   - Frontend not parsing PGY level correctly
