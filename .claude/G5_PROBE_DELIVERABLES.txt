   - Contingency analysis (accuracy verification needed)

3. PHASED DEPLOYMENT (4 weeks):
   - Phase 1 (Week 1): Core scheduling (4 agents)
   - Phase 2 (Week 2): Compliance & resilience (4 agents)
   - Phase 3 (Week 3): Burnout & strategic planning (3 agents)
   - Phase 4 (Week 4): Support systems (5+ agents)

4. NO BLOCKING DEPENDENCIES:
   - All 36 MCP-independent agents can run in parallel
   - Safe to deploy core development/infrastructure concurrently

FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

This analysis represents a comprehensive assessment of all 61 agents in the
system and identifies clear paths for MCP integration.

KEY INSIGHT: Only 1/3 of agents require MCP tools. The other 2/3 can operate
independently, allowing parallel development and deployment.

RECOMMENDATION: Follow the phased deployment strategy over 4 weeks, starting
with mission-critical agents (P0), then health monitoring (P1), then support
systems (P2-P3).

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH - All agents have been examined, tool requirements
clearly identified, risk mitigation strategies well-defined, and deployment
path is realistic and achievable.
