# Gitleaks Ignore File
# See: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#gitleaksignore
#
# This file contains FINGERPRINTS of specific findings to ignore.
# For path-based exclusions, see .gitleaks.toml
#
# Format: Each line is a fingerprint (from gitleaks output)
# Example: backend/app/api/routes/auth.py:generic-api-key:229
#
# To get fingerprints, run:
#   gitleaks detect --no-git --verbose --config .gitleaks.toml
# Then copy the "Fingerprint:" value for any remaining false positives.
#
# Note: Most false positives are now handled by path/regex rules in
# .gitleaks.toml. Only add fingerprints here for edge cases.
