# Constraint Diff Report (v1 -- SUPERSEDED)

NOTE: This is the v1 diff report which has split-block contamination issues (e.g., Dermatology learning FMIT min=2 max=46). The v2 diff with split-block awareness, confidence tiers, and anomaly detection was generated on Mini at /tmp/constraint_diff_v2.md. See ml_mining_results_context.md for the v2 summary.

Summary (v1): 2 matched, 0 tighter, 50 wider, 66 new (missing from DB), 30 orphaned (in DB, not observed)

Comparing learned constraints (from historical HDAs) to existing rotation_activity_requirements.
