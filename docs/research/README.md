## 🎯 Research Philosophy

This research explores **exotic metaphors** and **cross-pollination** from diverse scientific fields. The goal is to find novel solutions to scheduling problems by:

1. **Borrowing Proven Concepts** - Take mechanisms that work in other domains
2. **Adapting to Context** - Translate concepts to residency scheduling
3. **Rigorous Implementation** - Ground exotic ideas in solid engineering
4. **Measuring Impact** - Quantify improvements over baseline

### Why This Approach?

**Scheduling is hard.** Traditional operations research and optimization often hit limits when dealing with:
- Strategic human behavior (gaming the system)
- Fairness vs. efficiency trade-offs
- Complex preferences and constraints
- Dynamic, evolving systems
- Emergent behavior

By looking to fields like **game theory, epidemiology, ecology, and physics**, we find:
- Proven mathematical frameworks
- Battle-tested algorithms
- Novel perspectives on old problems
- Rigorous guarantees (strategyproofness, stability, fairness)
