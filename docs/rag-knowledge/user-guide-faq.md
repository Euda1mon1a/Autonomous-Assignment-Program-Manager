## Managing Schedule Changes and Swaps

### How do I swap a shift with another resident?

**Quick swap process:**

1. **Identify shift to swap:** Decide which shift/block you want to trade
2. **Log into scheduling system**
3. **Go to "My Schedule"**
4. **Click on the shift you want to swap**
5. **Select "Request Swap"**
6. **Choose swap type:**
   - One-to-one swap (trade shifts)
   - Absorb swap (give away shift)
7. **Find swap partner:**
   - Use auto-matcher (recommended)
   - Send direct request to specific person
   - Post to swap board

**Auto-matcher (easiest method):**
- System shows compatible residents who can swap
- Displays compatibility score (higher = better match)
- Select preferred partner and send request
- Partner accepts or declines
- System automatically validates ACGME compliance

**After partner accepts:**
- System checks coverage and compliance
- If approved, swap is finalized immediately
- Both parties receive confirmation
- Schedule updates automatically

**Detailed swap information:** See "Schedule Swap System" section for complete details on swap types, approval process, and 24-hour rollback window.

### Can I cancel a swap after it's been approved?

**Yes, within 24 hours (rollback window):**
- Log into scheduling system
- Go to "My Swaps"
- Find the swap
- Click "Rollback Swap"
- Provide brief reason
- Schedule reverts to original immediately

**After 24 hours:**
- Requires new approval (same level as original swap)
- Must demonstrate valid reason (emergency, unforeseen conflict)
- May be denied if too close to swap date
- Contact chief resident to discuss

**Emergency cancellations:**
- Medical or family emergencies always permitted
- Contact chief resident immediately
- System allows emergency rollback with documentation

### What if my swap request is denied?

**Common reasons for denial:**
- ACGME compliance violation (you or partner would exceed duty hours)
- Coverage gap (no one available to cover the shift)
- Credential mismatch (partner not qualified for your rotation)
- Too close to shift date (insufficient time to coordinate)

**What to do:**
1. **Review denial reason:** System provides specific explanation
2. **Contact program coordinator:** Discuss alternatives
3. **Try different partner:** Auto-matcher may suggest other options
4. **Adjust dates:** Consider swapping different shifts
5. **Escalate if needed:** Program director can review appeals

**Alternatives if swap denied:**
- Request regular time off instead (if coverage allows)
- Find coverage through chief resident
- Coordinate informally with attending (still must log in system)

## Understanding Your Schedule

### What is a "block" and how does it work?

**Block definition:**
- Each day is divided into AM and PM sessions
- **AM block:** Morning shift (typically 7 AM - 7 PM)
- **PM block:** Evening/night shift (typically 7 PM - 7 AM)
- Each block is 12 hours (standard clinical shift)

**Academic year structure:**
- 365 days × 2 blocks/day = 730 total blocks
- Blocks are numbered sequentially: Day 1 AM = Block 1, Day 1 PM = Block 2, etc.

**Block assignments:**
- You're assigned to a rotation for a specific set of blocks
- Example: "Inpatient Medicine, Blocks 100-155" = 4-week rotation (28 days × 2 blocks/day = 56 blocks)

**Why blocks matter:**
- Precise scheduling (no ambiguity about shift times)
- Easy to track hours (each block = 12 hours)
- ACGME compliance calculated based on blocks worked

### What do the different rotation types mean?

**Common rotation categories:**

**Inpatient Rotations:**
- General medicine ward service
- Subspecialty consult services (cardiology, pulmonary)
- Intensive care unit (ICU)
- You care for hospitalized patients
- Typically includes night/weekend call

**Outpatient/Clinic Rotations:**
- Continuity clinic (your own panel of patients)
- Subspecialty clinics
- Usually daytime, Monday-Friday
- Focus on ambulatory care

**Procedure Rotations:**
- Endoscopy, bronchoscopy, cardiac cath
- Operating room time
- Skill-building focus

**Night Float:**
- Dedicated overnight coverage (usually 1-2 weeks)
- You work only night shifts during this rotation
- Cover admissions and overnight issues
- Helps reduce night call during other rotations

**Elective Rotations:**
- You choose based on your interests
- Subspecialty exploration
- Research time
- Away rotations at other hospitals

**Conference/Education:**
- Protected educational time
- Board review courses
- Simulation training
- Cannot be canceled for clinical duties

### How do I know if I'm compliant with ACGME duty hours?

**Automatic monitoring:**
The scheduling system automatically tracks your duty hours and alerts you if approaching limits.

**View your compliance status:**
1. Log into scheduling system
2. Go to "My Duty Hours"
3. See real-time dashboard:
   - Current week hours
   - 4-week rolling average
   - Days off in last 7/28 days
   - Call frequency
   - Color-coded status (Green/Yellow/Red)

**Color codes:**
- **Green:** Fully compliant, comfortable margin
- **Yellow:** Approaching limits, be aware
- **Red:** At or near ACGME limits, immediate attention needed

**What counts toward duty hours:**
- All clinical work
- Educational conferences
- Administrative duties
- In-house call (including sleep time)
- Moonlighting

**What doesn't count:**
- Personal study time
- Reading at home
- Voluntary research outside scheduled time

**If you're concerned about compliance:**
- Contact chief resident immediately
- System should prevent scheduling violations automatically
- Program coordinator can review your schedule
- Never work beyond limits without documenting and reporting

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### I can't log into the scheduling system

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Check credentials:** Ensure you're using institutional username/password
2. **Reset password:** Use "Forgot Password" link on login page
3. **Clear browser cache:** Sometimes cached data causes login issues
4. **Try different browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
5. **Check VPN:** Some systems require VPN for off-campus access
6. **Contact IT:** If none of the above work, call IT help desk

**Common causes:**
- Expired password (must be reset every 90 days)
- Account not activated (new residents)
- Network/firewall issues
- System maintenance (check for announcements)

### My schedule isn't showing up or looks wrong

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Refresh page:** Click refresh button or press Ctrl+R (PC) / Cmd+R (Mac)
2. **Log out and back in:** Sometimes fixes sync issues
3. **Check date range:** Make sure you're viewing correct time period
4. **Clear cache:** Browser cache can show outdated schedule
5. **Check announcements:** System may be undergoing updates

**If schedule is actually incorrect:**
1. **Take screenshot:** Document what you're seeing
2. **Contact program coordinator immediately:** Provide screenshot
3. **Do not assume:** Always confirm correct assignment before showing up
4. **Call chief resident:** If coordinator is unavailable and shift is soon

**Schedule update delays:**
- Changes typically appear within 15 minutes
- Calendar exports may take up to 30 minutes to sync
- If >1 hour, contact IT support

### I wasn't notified about a schedule change

**Notification methods:**
The system sends notifications via:
- **Email:** To your institutional email
- **In-app notifications:** Push notifications on mobile app
- **Text/SMS:** If you've enabled SMS alerts

**If you missed a notification:**

1. **Check email spam folder:** Notifications sometimes filtered as spam
2. **Check notification settings:** In system, go to Settings → Notifications
3. **Enable all notification methods:** Email + app + SMS for redundancy
4. **Add scheduling system to safe senders:** Prevent spam filtering
5. **Check app permissions:** Ensure push notifications are enabled

**Best practices:**
- Check schedule daily (takes 30 seconds)
- Enable all notification methods
- Respond to schedule queries promptly
- Don't rely solely on notifications

### The auto-matcher isn't showing any compatible swap partners

**Common reasons:**

1. **ACGME constraints:** No one can accept your swap without exceeding duty hours
2. **Coverage gaps:** All potential partners are already covering critical services
3. **Credential mismatches:** Partners don't have required certifications for your rotation
4. **Date constraints:** Limited availability during your requested dates

**What to do:**

1. **Expand date flexibility:** Try different dates for the swap
2. **Try partial swap:** Swap only some blocks instead of entire shift
3. **Post to swap board:** Open request to all residents, not just auto-matched
4. **Contact program coordinator:** They can manually review options
5. **Consider absorb swap:** Just give away shift (don't require one back)
6. **Request regular time off:** If swap isn't working, try standard leave request

### I think there's an ACGME violation in my schedule

**Immediate steps:**

1. **Document the concern:** Write down specific issue (hours, days off, etc.)
2. **Check your duty hour dashboard:** Verify actual hours worked
3. **Contact chief resident immediately:** Explain your concern
4. **Do not work unsafe hours:** If you're too fatigued, you must speak up

**Common ACGME violations:**
- Working >80 hours/week (4-week average)
- Not getting 1 day off in 7 (4-week average)
- Less than 10 hours between shifts
- Working >28 consecutive hours

**Program will:**
- Investigate immediately
- Adjust schedule if violation confirmed
- Provide compensatory time off
- Document and report to ACGME if required

**Your rights:**
- Protected from retaliation for good-faith reporting
- Anonymous reporting options available
- ACGME compliance is non-negotiable

**If program doesn't address:**
- Contact GME office
- File anonymous report with ACGME
- Document all communications

## Tips for Success

### Maximizing schedule satisfaction

**Proactive strategies:**
