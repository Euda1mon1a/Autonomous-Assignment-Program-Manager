# ACGME Duty Hour Requirements

## Overview

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) establishes duty hour requirements to ensure resident well-being, patient safety, and educational quality. These requirements apply to all ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs and are enforced through regular program reviews and compliance monitoring.

## Maximum Work Hours

### 80-Hour Maximum Work Week

Residents must not exceed **80 hours per week** of clinical and educational work, averaged over a **rolling 4-week period**. This is the most fundamental ACGME requirement and applies to all residency programs regardless of specialty.

**Key Points:**
- The 80-hour limit is calculated as an average over any consecutive 4-week block
- Includes all clinical and educational activities
- Programs must monitor and document compliance weekly
- Systematic violations can result in program citation or probation

**What Counts Toward the 80-Hour Limit:**
- Direct patient care activities
- Educational conferences and didactics
- Administrative duties related to patient care
- In-house call time (including sleep time during call)
- Moonlighting activities (external clinical work)

**What Does NOT Count:**
- Time spent on personal study and preparation
- Reading medical literature outside of work hours
- Voluntary research activities conducted outside scheduled work time

### Moonlighting

All moonlighting (internal or external) must be counted toward the 80-hour weekly limit. Programs must have a policy for monitoring moonlighting hours and ensuring residents report these hours accurately.

## Mandatory Time Off

### One Day Off in Seven Rule

Residents must have **at least one 24-hour period free from all clinical, educational, and administrative activities every 7 days**, averaged over 4 weeks. This is commonly referred to as the "1-in-7 rule."

**Implementation:**
- The day off must be a continuous 24-hour period
- Can be averaged over 4 weeks (e.g., 4 days off per 28-day period)
- Applies to both clinical and educational activities
- Cannot be scheduled immediately before or after night float to avoid creating extended work periods

**Exceptions:**
- Strategic patient care activities when necessary for continuity
- Must be logged and justified in residency management systems
- Cannot be systematic or routine

### Minimum Rest Between Shifts

Residents must have a **minimum of 10 hours free from all duties** between scheduled clinical work and education periods.

**Critical Exceptions:**
- Residents may remain on-site for up to 4 additional hours for patient care continuity and educational debriefing after a 24-hour shift
- Total continuous time on-site cannot exceed 28 hours (24 hours + 4 hours)
- The 10-hour rest period must begin immediately after the 24-28 hour period ends

## Maximum Shift Length

### Standard Shifts

For routine clinical duties, shifts should be designed to minimize fatigue and ensure resident alertness. While the ACGME does not specify a maximum for routine shifts other than the 80-hour weekly limit, programs must ensure schedules promote adequate rest.

### Extended Duration and On-Call Activities

**24-Hour Maximum Plus Handoff Time:**
- Residents may work a maximum of **24 consecutive hours** of clinical duty
- An additional **4 hours** is permitted for continuity of care and educational activities (total 28 hours maximum)
- The additional 4 hours must be used for:
  - Patient handoff/transitions of care
  - Educational debriefing
  - Direct patient care when needed for continuity
- Residents must not accept new patients during the final 4 hours except when needed for continuity

**Post-Call Requirements:**
- After 24 hours of in-house call, residents must have at least 10 hours free of duty
- No new patients can be accepted after 24 hours on duty (except for continuity)
- Residents should not be assigned additional clinical responsibilities during the final 4-hour period

### In-House Call Frequency

Residents must not be scheduled for in-house call more frequently than **every third night**, averaged over a 4-week period.

**Calculation:**
- Based on a rolling 4-week average
- Example: In a 28-day period, maximum of approximately 9-10 in-house call shifts
- Home call (where resident can rest at home) does not count toward this limit

## PGY-1 Specific Restrictions

First-year residents (PGY-1, also called interns) have additional protective restrictions:

### Clinical Experience and Supervision Oversight

**Maximum Shift Length:**
- PGY-1 residents may work no more than **16 consecutive hours** (strict limit, no averaging)
- No additional time for handoff is permitted beyond the 16 hours
- This is a hard cap that cannot be exceeded under any circumstances

**Exceptions and Transitions:**
- Some specialties may petition for 24-hour shifts for PGY-1 residents if educationally justified
- Must demonstrate appropriate supervision and educational value
- Requires ACGME approval through the Review Committee

### Enhanced Supervision Requirements

- PGY-1 residents must have direct supervision readily available
- Senior residents or attending physicians must be immediately available (in-house or by phone/pager)
- Cannot take independent call from home during PGY-1 year

## Supervision Ratios

While not strictly "duty hours," supervision ratios are critical ACGME requirements that affect scheduling:

### Faculty-to-Resident Ratios

**PGY-1 Residents:**
- Minimum ratio: **1 supervising faculty member per 2 PGY-1 residents**
- Faculty must be immediately available (in-house or remotely)
- Direct oversight required for all patient care decisions

**PGY-2 and PGY-3 Residents:**
- Minimum ratio: **1 supervising faculty member per 4 PGY-2/3 residents**
- Faculty must be available for consultation
- Progressive independence with oversight

### Clinical Setting Variations

Supervision requirements may vary by clinical setting:
- **Inpatient units:** Attending must be physically present or available by phone
- **Emergency department:** Direct supervision for complex cases
- **Outpatient clinics:** Precepting physician must review all patient encounters
- **Procedures:** Graduated supervision based on resident competency

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Program Responsibilities

Programs must:
1. **Monitor duty hours weekly** through electronic logging systems
2. **Review violations immediately** and implement corrective action
3. **Educate residents annually** on duty hour requirements
4. **Maintain documentation** for ACGME site visits
5. **Report systematic violations** to the ACGME

### Resident Responsibilities

Residents must:
1. **Log duty hours accurately** and promptly (typically within 72 hours)
2. **Report violations** to program leadership
3. **Participate in fatigue mitigation education**
4. **Understand their rights** under ACGME requirements

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

Programs found in violation may face:
- **Warning:** Minor or isolated violations
- **Probation:** Systematic or repeated violations
- **Withdrawal of accreditation:** Severe or uncorrected violations
- **Adverse action:** Public notification and program citations

## Special Considerations

### Backup Call

When residents are on backup call (second call), they must have:
- At least 10 hours off before returning to duty if activated
- Time spent on backup call counts toward the 80-hour limit if the resident is activated

### Strategic Patient Care

Programs may allow residents to exceed duty hour limits in rare circumstances when:
- Required for continuity of care for a single severely ill or unstable patient
- The resident determines that transfer would jeopardize patient safety
- The program must review and document all such circumstances
- Cannot be a routine or systematic practice

### Transitions of Care

While managing duty hours, programs must balance:
- Adequate rest and time off
- Continuity of patient care
- Effective handoff communication
- Educational opportunities during transitions

Handoffs are critical times that require structured communication protocols and dedicated time within the duty hour limits.

## Integration with Scheduling Systems

Automated scheduling systems must:
1. **Validate compliance in real-time** before finalizing assignments
2. **Calculate rolling 4-week averages** for 80-hour and 1-in-7 compliance
3. **Prevent assignment of shifts** that would violate limits
4. **Alert program directors** when residents approach thresholds
5. **Generate compliance reports** for ACGME documentation

### Calculation Examples

**80-Hour Week Averaging:**
- Week 1: 78 hours
- Week 2: 82 hours
- Week 3: 75 hours
- Week 4: 81 hours
- **Average: 79 hours** ✓ Compliant

**1-in-7 Day Off:**
- 28-day period requires: **Minimum 4 full 24-hour days off**
- Acceptable: Days 7, 14, 21, 28 (every 7 days)
- Also acceptable: Days 5, 12, 20, 27 (averaging to 1 in 7)

**In-House Call Frequency:**
- 28-day period: Maximum ~9 in-house call shifts
- Cannot schedule: Monday call, Tuesday call, Wednesday call (violates every-3rd-night rule)
- Acceptable: Monday call, Thursday call, Sunday call (minimum 2 nights between)
