# Schedule Swap System

## Overview

The schedule swap system allows residents and faculty to exchange scheduled assignments while maintaining coverage requirements and ACGME compliance. The system provides automated matching, validation, and approval workflows to facilitate swaps efficiently and safely.

## Swap Types

### One-to-One Swap

A **one-to-one swap** (also called a bilateral swap or trade) occurs when two individuals exchange scheduled assignments for mutual benefit.

**Characteristics:**
- Two participants exchange equivalent time blocks
- Both parties must explicitly agree to the swap
- Coverage is maintained throughout the swap period
- Both participants must be qualified for each other's assignments

**Example:**
- Dr. Smith is scheduled for clinic on Monday AM
- Dr. Jones is scheduled for clinic on Tuesday AM
- They agree to swap: Dr. Smith takes Tuesday AM, Dr. Jones takes Monday AM
- Coverage for clinic is maintained on both days

**Use Cases:**
- Personal appointments or obligations
- Balancing workload across a rotation
- Accommodating educational opportunities
- Family or personal preferences

### Absorb Swap (Give-Away)

An **absorb swap** (also called a give-away or unilateral swap) occurs when one individual gives away a scheduled shift without receiving anything in return.

**Characteristics:**
- One participant gives away their scheduled shift
- Another participant accepts the additional shift
- The recipient must have capacity within ACGME duty hour limits
- Often used when someone needs time off and another needs extra shifts

**Example:**
- Dr. Smith is scheduled for call on Friday night
- Dr. Smith has a family obligation and requests to give away the shift
- Dr. Jones is willing to take an extra call shift
- Dr. Jones absorbs Dr. Smith's Friday night call

**Use Cases:**
- Emergency personal time off
- Medical appointments or illness
- Building compensatory time for future needs
- Residents who want additional clinical experience

### Partial Swap

A **partial swap** involves exchanging only part of a scheduled assignment rather than the entire rotation or shift.

**Example:**
- Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones are both on inpatient service for 4 weeks
- They swap weekend coverage for weeks 2 and 3 only
- Core rotation assignments remain unchanged

## Swap Request Process

### Step 1: Initiate Swap Request

**How to Request:**
1. Log into the scheduling system
2. Navigate to "My Schedule"
3. Select the shift or block to swap
4. Click "Request Swap"
5. Specify swap type (one-to-one or absorb)
6. Add notes explaining the reason (optional but recommended)

**Information Required:**
- Date(s) and block(s) to be swapped
- Swap type selection
- Reason for swap (for approval consideration)
- Any specific constraints or preferences

### Step 2: Find a Swap Partner

The system offers three methods to find a swap partner:

**Method 1: Auto-Matching (Recommended)**

The system's intelligent auto-matcher finds compatible swap partners based on:
- **Availability:** Who is scheduled on desired dates?
- **Qualifications:** Who has the required credentials for each rotation?
- **ACGME Compliance:** Who can accept the swap without violating duty hour limits?
- **Swap History:** Who has swapped with you before or owes/needs swaps?
- **Preferences:** Who has indicated interest in similar swaps?

**How Auto-Matching Works:**
1. You submit a swap request
2. System analyzes all potential matches
3. Presents ranked list of compatible partners
4. Shows compatibility score (0-100%) for each candidate
5. You select preferred partner(s) from the list

**Compatibility Factors:**
- **100% match:** Perfect swap with no issues
- **80-99% match:** Good swap, minor considerations
- **60-79% match:** Acceptable swap, some limitations
- **<60% match:** Challenging swap, may require approval override

**Method 2: Direct Request**

If you already know who you want to swap with:
1. Search for the person by name
2. Send them a direct swap request
3. System validates compatibility
4. Partner accepts or declines

**Method 3: Open Swap Board**

Post your swap request to a public board where:
- All eligible residents can view open swap requests
- Interested parties can respond
- You review responses and select a partner
- Useful when flexibility exists on dates or partners

### Step 3: Partner Acceptance

Once you've identified a swap partner:
1. **Request sent:** Partner receives notification (email and in-app)
2. **Partner reviews:** Partner has 48 hours to respond (configurable)
3. **Partner decision:**
   - **Accept:** Swap moves to validation phase
   - **Decline:** You can select another partner or cancel request
   - **Propose alternative:** Partner suggests different dates/blocks

**Negotiation:**
If initial terms aren't acceptable, partners can negotiate:
- Propose alternative dates
- Adjust which blocks are included
- Add contingencies or conditions
- System tracks all communications for audit trail

### Step 4: System Validation

Once both parties agree, the system automatically validates:

**ACGME Compliance Checks:**
- Would either party exceed 80 hours/week (4-week rolling average)?
- Would either party lose their 1 day off in 7 (4-week rolling average)?
- Is there adequate rest between shifts (10-hour minimum)?
- Would call frequency exceed every-3rd-night limit?
- For PGY-1: Would shift exceed 16-hour limit?

**Coverage Validation:**
- Does each rotation maintain minimum staffing levels?
- Are there overlapping assignments or conflicts?
- Are there any blocked-out periods (mandatory conferences, etc.)?

**Credential Validation:**
- Does each person have required certifications for the new assignment?
- Are immunizations current?
- Has required training been completed?
- Are privileges adequate for the rotation?

**Result of Validation:**
- **Pass:** Swap proceeds to approval queue
- **Fail:** Swap is rejected with specific reason provided
- **Warning:** Swap is flagged for manual review (borderline cases)

### Step 5: Approval Workflow

Swap requests follow a tiered approval process based on timing and complexity:

**Tier 1: Auto-Approved (No Manual Review)**
Swaps that meet all criteria are automatically approved:
- More than 2 weeks in advance
- Pass all validation checks without warnings
- Routine rotations (not high-acuity or critical coverage)
- Both parties are in good standing (no recent swap violations)

**Tier 2: Chief Resident Approval**
Swaps requiring basic approval:
- 1-2 weeks in advance
- Minor validation warnings
- Involves call or weekend coverage
- Approved within 24 hours

**Tier 3: Program Director Approval**
Complex swaps requiring senior review:
- Less than 1 week in advance
- Significant validation warnings (close to ACGME limits)
- Involves critical rotations (ICU, trauma)
- Emergency or unusual circumstances
- Approved within 48 hours

**Tier 4: Department Chair Approval**
Exceptional swaps requiring highest authority:
- Policy exceptions
- Educational impact concerns
- Repeated swap requests from same individual
- Appeals of denied swaps

### Step 6: Execution and Notification

Once approved:
1. **Schedule updated:** Changes immediately reflected in published schedule
2. **Notifications sent:**
   - Both swap participants (confirmation email)
   - Rotation supervisors (attending physicians)
   - Program coordinator (for records)
   - Chief resident (for awareness)
3. **Calendar sync:** Updated schedules pushed to personal calendars
4. **Audit log:** Complete record created for compliance documentation

## 24-Hour Rollback Window

### Rollback Policy

All swaps include a **24-hour rollback window** (sometimes called a cooling-off period) during which either party can cancel the swap without penalty.

**Rollback Rules:**
- Available for 24 hours after swap approval
- Either party can initiate rollback (doesn't require mutual agreement)
- Rollback must include brief reason (for tracking)
- Schedule immediately reverts to original assignments
- All parties notified of rollback

**When to Use Rollback:**
- Discovered scheduling conflict after accepting
- Personal circumstances changed
- Misunderstood the swap terms
- Found a better alternative arrangement
- Made error in requesting swap

**After 24-Hour Window:**
- Rollback requires the same approval level as the original swap
- Must demonstrate valid reason for late cancellation
- May be denied if close to swap date or coverage is impacted
- Excessive late rollbacks may result in swap privilege restrictions

### Emergency Cancellation

After the 24-hour rollback window, emergency cancellations are permitted for:
- Medical emergencies (illness, injury)
- Family emergencies (death, serious illness)
- Unforeseen circumstances beyond resident's control

Emergency cancellations require:
- Immediate notification to chief resident
- Documentation of emergency (when appropriate)
- Good faith effort to find replacement coverage
- Program director review after the fact

## ACGME Compliance During Swaps

### Pre-Swap Validation

Before any swap is finalized, the system performs comprehensive ACGME validation:

**80-Hour Week Check:**
- Calculates hours for 4-week period including the swap
- Accounts for all scheduled shifts, call, and educational time
- Factors in any moonlighting hours (if reported)
- Rejects swap if either party would exceed 80-hour average

**Example:**
- Current 4-week average: Resident A = 76 hours, Resident B = 72 hours
- Proposed swap: Exchange Friday 12-hour shift for Saturday 24-hour call
- Validation: Resident A would increase to 88 hours → REJECTED
- Alternative: System suggests swapping equivalent-hour shifts instead

**1-in-7 Day Off Check:**
- Verifies each party maintains at least one 24-hour period off per 7 days (4-week average)
- Ensures swap doesn't eliminate a scheduled day off
- Checks that new assignment doesn't create extended work periods without rest

**10-Hour Rest Period Check:**
- Validates minimum rest between end of one shift and start of next
- Accounts for travel time if swap involves different locations
- Ensures adequate sleep opportunity between shifts

**Call Frequency Check:**
- Verifies in-house call doesn't exceed every-3rd-night frequency
- Calculates rolling 4-week average for call nights
- Prevents consecutive call nights unless educationally justified and approved

### Post-Swap Monitoring

After swap execution, the system continues monitoring:
- Real-time duty hour tracking
- Alerts if subsequent changes (additional swaps, sick leave) create violations
- Weekly compliance reports reviewed by program leadership
- Monthly compliance summaries for ACGME documentation

### Swap Violation Remediation

If a swap inadvertently creates an ACGME violation:
1. **Immediate alert:** System notifies all parties and program director
2. **Investigation:** Determine cause (system error, unreported hours, subsequent changes)
3. **Remediation:** Implement corrective action (schedule adjustment, compensatory time off)
4. **Documentation:** Record violation and remediation for ACGME reporting
5. **Process improvement:** Update validation algorithms if system error identified

## Swap History and Fairness

### Tracking Swap Balance

The system tracks swap history to promote fairness:

**Swap Credits:**
- When you give away a shift (absorb swap), you earn a "swap credit"
- When you take an extra shift, you use a "swap credit"
- Credits tracked over the academic year

**Swap Equity Score:**
- Residents can view their swap balance (net swaps given vs. received)
- Encourages reciprocity in the swap system
- Helps identify residents who frequently need swaps vs. those who help others

**Example:**
- Dr. Smith has given away 3 shifts and taken 1 extra: +2 swap credit balance
- Dr. Jones has taken 4 extra shifts and given away 1: -3 swap credit balance
- Dr. Jones may be prioritized for future swap requests to balance equity

### Swap Frequency Limits

To prevent abuse and ensure educational continuity:

**Maximum Swap Limits:**
- **Per month:** Maximum 4 swap requests per resident
- **Per block:** Maximum 2 swaps within a single 4-week rotation
- **Per academic year:** Maximum 20 swaps (exceptions for documented needs)

**Exceptions:**
- Medical or family emergencies (don't count toward limits)
- Program-initiated swaps for coverage needs
- Educational opportunities (conferences, interviews)

### Red Flags and Monitoring

The system flags concerning swap patterns:
- **Excessive swap requests:** More than 3x program average
- **Last-minute swaps:** Pattern of swaps within 72 hours of shift
- **One-way relationships:** Always receiving swaps, never giving
- **Rotation avoidance:** Pattern of swapping away from specific rotations

Flagged patterns trigger:
- Review by chief resident and program director
- Conversation with resident to understand underlying issues
- Potential restrictions on swap privileges if abuse identified
- Referral to resident wellness resources if needed

## Best Practices for Requesting Swaps

### Timing

- **Plan ahead:** Request swaps at least 2 weeks in advance when possible
- **Be flexible:** Offer multiple potential swap partners or dates
- **Avoid peak times:** Be mindful of requesting swaps during high-demand periods (holidays, exam seasons)

### Communication

- **Be clear:** Specify exactly which blocks you want to swap
- **Explain why:** Provide context (helps approvers and potential partners)
- **Be responsive:** Reply promptly to swap requests from others
- **Express gratitude:** Thank swap partners for their flexibility

### Reciprocity

- **Give as well as take:** Accept swap requests from others when possible
- **Build relationships:** Develop swap partnerships with colleagues
- **Pay it forward:** Help others even if you don't need immediate return swap

### Professionalism

- **Honor commitments:** Don't abuse the 24-hour rollback window
- **Be reliable:** Show up prepared for swapped shifts
- **Communicate changes:** Notify attending physicians about swaps
- **Respect educational goals:** Don't swap away from rotations important for your training

## Technical Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: Auto-matcher shows no compatible partners**
- **Cause:** Limited availability, ACGME constraints, credential gaps
- **Solution:** Expand date flexibility, consider partial swaps, contact program coordinator

**Problem: Swap request stuck in "pending" status**
- **Cause:** Partner hasn't responded, system validation error, approval queue backlog
- **Solution:** Send reminder to partner, contact chief resident after 48 hours

**Problem: Swap denied by system validation**
- **Cause:** ACGME violation, coverage gap, credential mismatch
- **Solution:** Review detailed rejection reason, contact program coordinator for alternatives

**Problem: Swap shows as approved but schedule not updated**
