---

## Hysteresis Logic (Oscillation Prevention)

### Why Hysteresis Matters

**Without hysteresis:** System could escalate GREEN → YELLOW → ORANGE → YELLOW → GREEN rapidly (multiple times per day), causing alarm fatigue and ineffective response.

**With hysteresis:** System requires sustained conditions before changing levels, allowing interventions to take effect.

### Implementation Rules

**ESCALATION (requires evidence of sustained elevation):**
- Escalate on 2nd consecutive day of threshold being met
- Exception: Emergency conditions (FWI > 80 or coverage < 70%) escalate immediately

**DE-ESCALATION (requires sustained improvement):**
- De-escalate on 3rd consecutive day below threshold
- More conservative (harder to de-escalate than escalate)
- Reason: Protections take time to work; de-escalating too early can cause rebound

### Example Timeline

```
Day 1, Morning:  FWI 42 (suggest ORANGE)
                 Current level: YELLOW
                 Hysteresis check: Candidate = ORANGE, count = 1
                 Action: REMAIN YELLOW, monitor

Day 1, Evening:  FWI 44 (suggest ORANGE)
                 Hysteresis check: Candidate = ORANGE, count = 2
                 Action: ESCALATE TO ORANGE ✓

Day 2, Morning:  FWI 40 (suggest CONTROL)
                 Current level: ORANGE
                 Hysteresis check: Within buffer (37 < 40 < 42)
                 Action: REMAIN ORANGE, monitor

Day 2, Evening:  FWI 39 (suggest CONTROL)
                 Hysteresis check: Below threshold, candidate = YELLOW, count = 1
                 Action: REMAIN ORANGE, monitor

Day 3, Morning:  FWI 38 (suggest CONTROL)
                 Hysteresis check: Below threshold, candidate = YELLOW, count = 2
                 Action: REMAIN ORANGE, monitor

Day 3, Evening:  FWI 36 (suggest CONTROL)
                 Hysteresis check: Below threshold, candidate = YELLOW, count = 3
                 Action: DE-ESCALATE TO YELLOW ✓
```

## Manual Override Procedures

### Emergency Escalation

**Use:** Sudden critical event (multiple unexpected absences, major staff departure)

**Procedure:**
1. [ ] Program director initiates override request
2. [ ] Logs reason in system (audit trail)
3. [ ] System applies override (skips hysteresis)
4. [ ] Immediately activates target level
5. [ ] Sends critical alerts to leadership

**Override Duration:** Until manually cancelled or 24 hours (whichever comes first)

**Example:**
```
Override Request:
  Type: Emergency Escalation
  From Level: YELLOW
  To Level: ORANGE (immediately)
  Reason: "3 faculty called in sick unexpectedly (net -30% staff)"
  Applied By: Program Director Smith
  Timestamp: 2025-12-31 0645 hrs
  Duration: Until cancelled
```
