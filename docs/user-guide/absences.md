## How Absences Affect Scheduling

### Integration with Schedule Generation

When you generate a schedule, the system:

1. **Checks all absences** in the date range
2. **Prevents scheduling** people during their absences
3. **Considers coverage needs** created by absences
4. **Adjusts workload** for remaining staff

### Before Schedule Generation

**Best practices:**
1. Enter ALL known absences before generating
2. Review the absence calendar for conflicts
3. Check for adequate coverage during absences
4. Coordinate overlapping absences

**Why this matters:**
- Algorithm can't schedule absent people
- Helps avoid coverage gaps
- Reduces need for schedule regeneration
- Prevents compliance violations

### After Schedule Generation

If you add an absence after generating a schedule:
- The schedule may now have gaps
- Compliance violations may appear
- You'll need to regenerate or manually adjust

**Recommendation:** Always enter absences BEFORE generating.

### Coverage Planning

Use absences to plan coverage:

**Review upcoming absences:**
1. Check the Dashboard "Upcoming Absences" card
2. Review the absence calendar
3. Identify periods with multiple people out
4. Plan extra coverage or adjust schedules

**High-absence periods:**
- Holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.)
- Summer vacation season
- Conference season
- End of academic year

### Impact on Compliance

Absences affect ACGME compliance:

**Positive impacts:**
- Vacation days count as days off (1-in-7 rule)
- Reduces weekly hours
- Prevents overwork

**Potential issues:**
- Too many people out = coverage gaps
- Remaining residents may be overworked
- Supervision ratios may be harder to maintain

**Monitor:** Always check the Compliance page after adding absences or generating schedules.

4. Confirm approval before making final plans
5. Arrange coverage for critical responsibilities

**When approving/denying:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much vacation time do I get?**
A: Check with your program director. This varies by program and is not automatically tracked in this system.

**Q: Do I need approval before entering an absence?**
A: Depends on your program's policy. Some programs want you to get approval first, others use the system as the request mechanism.

**Q: What if I need emergency time off?**

A: You can enter absences for any future date. Follow your program's policies for how far ahead to request.
