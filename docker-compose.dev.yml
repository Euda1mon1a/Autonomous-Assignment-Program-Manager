  # Frontend: NO DEV OVERRIDE
  # The production Dockerfile uses multi-stage build without node_modules.
  # Hot reload would require a separate dev Dockerfile or local npm install.
  # For now, frontend runs in production mode - rebuild on changes:
  #   docker compose build frontend && docker compose up -d frontend

  # NOTE: Port 8081 exposed for direct testing (8080 is primary via base compose)
