"""
Faculty-specific Constraints.

This module is reserved for faculty-specific constraints.
Currently, faculty-related logic (like SupervisionRatioConstraint) is in acgme_constraints.py
as it's an ACGME requirement.

This module can be used for future faculty-specific constraints such as:
- Faculty availability constraints
- Faculty workload balancing
- Faculty preference constraints
- Teaching load distribution
