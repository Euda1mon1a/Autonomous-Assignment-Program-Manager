"""
Modular Constraint System for Residency Scheduling.

This package provides a flexible, composable constraint system that can be used
with multiple solvers (OR-Tools CP-SAT, PuLP, custom algorithms).

Constraint Types:
- Hard Constraints: Must be satisfied (ACGME rules, availability, capacity)
- Soft Constraints: Should be optimized (preferences, equity, continuity)

Architecture:
- Constraint: Base class defining the interface
- HardConstraint: Constraints that must be satisfied
- SoftConstraint: Constraints with weights for optimization
- ConstraintManager: Composes and manages constraints for solvers

All classes are re-exported from this module to maintain backward compatibility
with existing code that imports directly from the constraints module.

Example:
    >>> from backend.app.scheduling.constraints import ConstraintManager
    >>> from backend.app.scheduling.constraints import AvailabilityConstraint
    >>> 
    >>> manager = ConstraintManager.create_default()
    >>> manager.add(AvailabilityConstraint())
